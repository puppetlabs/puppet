    calls 'retrieve' on each property if the resource exists.

    Fixed #1622 - Users and their groups should again add in one transaction

    A working script to create an OS X pkg out of the Puppet repository

    Fixed #1441 - Updated console colours

    Expose all puppet variables as instance member variables of the template wrapper.
    This helps resolve redmine #1427, by providing a safe mechanism to access variables.
    
     * Implement Puppet::Parser::Scope#to_hash, which returns a hash containing all the
       variable bindings in the current and, optionally, parent scope.
     * Use that to set instance member variables into Puppet::Parser::Templatewrapper
     * Report the time taken for variable binding at debug level, to help identify any
       performance regression that is encountered in the real world.
     * Rename the @scope and @file members of the template wrapper, to avoid clashing
       with a scope variable exposed within puppet.

    Ensure that we consistently use either string #{} interpolation or String.%
    interpolation, not both, to avoid issues where a #{} interpolated value
    contains a % character.

    Feature #1476: Allow specification of --bindir --sbindir --sitelibdir --mandir --destdir 
    in installation
    
    Added feature #1241 : Improve performance of group lookups

    Fixed bug #1448: Puppet CA incorrectly writes out all certs to inventory .txt on each 
    certificate signing

    Fixing puppetlast to make it work with 0.24.5 / 0.25.  Made puppetlast work on 0.24.5 
    by using the YAML indirector
 
0.24.5
    You can now select the encoding format when transferring the catalog,
    with 'yaml' still being the default but 'marshal' being an option.
    This is because testing has shown drastic performance differences
    between the two, with up to 70% of compile time being spent
    in YAML code.  Use the 'catalog_format' setting to choose your format,
    and the setting must be set on the client.

    Fixed #1431 - Provider confines must now specify similar tests in one call.
    I.e., you can't do confine :operatingsystem => %w{a b} and then
    confine :operatingsystem => %w{b c}; you'd need to do them in one command.
    This now-obsolete behaviour does not seem to be used anywhere.
    The fix for #1431 is actually just removing the tests that exposed
    this change; the change happened when I refactored how confines work.

    Removed faulty interface type

    Updated /spec/unit/rails.rb test

    Fix #1426 - services on redhat are restarted again and status is 
    called from the Red Hat provider

    Fixed #1414 - Return code from waitpid now right shifted 8 bits

    Fixed #174 - a native type type for managing ssh authorized_keys 
    files is available.

    Further moves from the examples directory and ext directory

    Fixed #1397 One line fix, fail instead of log

    Moved debian to conf and updated examples directory

    Fixed #1368 - updated Red Hat init scripts
 
    Added message referencing ReductiveLabs build library

    Fixed #1396 - Added sha1 function from DavidS to core
    
    Fixed #1399 - the ldap user provider now knows it can manage
    passwords.
    
    Fixed #1272 - if you provide a group name as the gid to an ldap
    user, the name will be converted to a gid.  Note that this only
    looks up ldap groups, at this point; if you want to set an ldap
    user's primary group to a local group, you have to specify the GID.

    Fixed #1226 - gems can now specify source repositories.

    Fixed #1232 - the rundir no longer specifies a user/group,
    and there are now client- and server-specific yaml directories.

    Fixed 1240 - puppet will function more like puppetd if graphing
    or reporting are enabled.
    
    Fixed #1231 - Exceptions during initialization should now be clearer.

    Fixed #1006 - puppetrun --class works again.  I added the class
    membership testing to the Ldap node terminus, and added tests,
    so it shouldn't break again.

    Fixed #1114 - Facts in plugin directories should now be autoloaded,
    as long as you're using Facter 1.5.

    Fixed #1195 - Updated Gentoo init scripts

    Fixed #1367 - Updated Rakefile for new daily builds

    Fixed #1370 - removed test/util/loadedfile.rb tests
    
    Fixed #1221 - aliases to titles now work for resources.
    
    Fixed #1012 - templates in the templatedir are preferred to module templates.

    Fixed #707 - special '@reboot'-style cron jobs work again.

    Fixed #1360 - allowdupe works on groups again.

    Fixed #1369 - the init service provider now supports HP-UX.

    Removed support for the 'node_name' setting in LDAP and external node 
    lookups.

    Also removed support for 'default' nodes in external nodes.
    LDAP nodes now use the certificate name, the short name, and 'default',
    but external nodes just use the certificate name and any custom terminus
    types will use just the certificate name.
    
    Fixing #1168 (for 0.24.x) -- automatically downcasing the fqdn.
    Also requiring that passed in certnames be downcased; the setting
    system isn't currently flexible enough to automatically downcase
    it for the user.

    Adding a ResourceTemplate class for using templates directly
    within resources (i.e., client-side templates).  This would really
    only be used for composite resources that pass the results of the
    template on to generated resources.

    Exporting or collecting resources no longer raises an exception
    when no storeconfigs is enabled, it just produces a warning.

    Always using the cert name to store yaml files, which fixes #1178.
    The Master handler previously provided the support for the :node_name
    setting, and that functionality has now been moved into the Node
    class.  At the same time, the names to search through have been
    changed somewhat:  Previously, the certificate name and the 
    hostname were both used for searching, but now, the cert name
    is always searched first (unless node_name == facter), but only
    the Facter hostname, domain, and fqdn are used otherwise.  We no
    longer split the cert name, only the hostname/domain/fqdn.

    Fixing transaction support for prefetching generated resources.

    Adding support for settings within the existing Facter provider confines.

    Moving all confine code out of the Provider class, and fixing #1197. 
    Created a Confiner module for the Provider class methods, enhanced 
    the interface between it and the Confine class to make sure binary 
    paths are searched for fresh each time.

    Modified the 'factpath' setting to automatically configure
    Facter to load facts there if a new enough version of
    Facter is used.

    Crontab provider: fix a parse error when a line begins with a space 
    character (fixes #1216)

    Instead of deleting the init scripts (with --del) we should simply 
    disable it with chkconfig service off, and respectfully do the same 
    for enable => true;
 
    Added ldap providers for users and groups.

    Added support for the --all option to puppetca --clean.  If
    puppetca --clean --all is issued then all client certificates
    are removed.
 
    Resources now return the 'should' value for properties from
    the [] accessor method (they previously threw an exception when
    this method was used with properties).  This shouldn't have any
    affect functionally; it just makes the method equivalent to 'should'
    for properties, but it works for all attribute types now.

    Modified the 'master' handler to use the Catalog class to
    compile node configurations, rather than using the Configuration
    handler, which was never used directly.  I removed the Configuration
    handler as a result.

    Modified the 'master' handler (responsible for sending configurations
    to clients) to always return Time.now as its compile date, so
    configurations will always get recompiled.

    Fixed #1184 -- definitions now autoload correctly all of the time.

    Removed the code from the client that tries to avoid recompiling
    the catalog. The client will now always recompile, assuming it
    can reach the server.  It will still use the cached config if
    there's a failure.

    Fixing #1173 -- classes and definitions can now have the same
    name as a directory with no failures.

    Saving new facts now expires any cached node information.

    Switching how caching is handled, so that objects now all
    have an expiration date associated with them.  This makes it
    much easier to know whether a given cached object should be used
    or if it should be regenerated.

    Changing the default environment to production.

0.24.4
    Pass source to pkg_add via the PKG_PATH environment variable if
    it ends in a '/' indicating it is a directory. Allows pkg_add
    to resolve dependancies, and make it possible to specify packages
    without version numbers.

    Fixing #571 -- provider suitability is now checked at resource
    evaluation time, rather than resource instantiation time.  This
    means that you don't catch your "errors" as early, but it also
    means you should be able to realistically configure a whole host
    in one run.

    Moved the configuration of the Node cache to the puppetmasterd
    executable, since it otherwise causes caches to be used in all
    cases, which we don't want (e.g., bin/puppet was using them).

    Ported #198 man page creation functionality to 0.24.x branch and
    added man pages and man page creation logic to install.rb.  The
    man pages are stored in man/man8 and will install to config::CONFIG
    mandir/man8.

    Fixing #1138 -- the yamldir is automatically created by the
    server now that it's in the :puppetmasterd section rather than
    a separate :yaml section.

    Disabling http keep-alive as a means of preventing #1010.
    There is now a constant in Puppet::Network::HttpPool that will
    disable or enable this feature, but note that we determined
    that it can cause corruption, especially in file serving (but
    it's client-side corruption).

    Applying patch by Ryan McBride to fix OpenBSD package 
    matching.  The actual problem was caused by the fix to #1001.

    Found all instances of methods where split() is used without
    any local variables and added a local variable -- see
    http://snurl.com/21zf8.  My own testing showed that this
    caused memory growth to level off at a reasonable level.
    Note that the link above says the problem is only with class
    methods, but my own testing showed that it's any method that
    meets these criteria.  This is not a functional change, but
    should hopefully be the last nail in the coffin of #1131.

    Found an array that leaked pretty quickly between reparsing
    files, thanks to work by Adam Jacob and Arjuna Christenson
    (the finding, not the leak).  I'm going to act like this
    fixes #1131, at least for now, but I doubt it does,
    since that shows general memory growth over time, whereas
    the leak here should go away as soon as files are reparsed
    (because the parser is holding the reference to the leaking
    array).

    Fixed #1147: Cached nodes are correctly considered out of
    date if the node facts have been updated (thus causing
    node facts to again be available in manifests, for those
    cases where they were not).

    Fixed #1137: The certificate name is correctly being added
    to the facts hash.

    Fixed #1136: Verbose and Debug no longer clobber each other.

    Hopefully *finally* fixed the "already being managed" problem
    (#1036).  The problem only cropped up if there was a failure
    when trying to manage the system -- this would cause the
    setting-based resources not to get cleaned up.

0.24.3
    Modified the ldap node terminus to also use the facts version
    as the version for a node, which should similarly encourage the
    use of the yaml cache.  (Related to #1130)

    Caching node information in yaml (I figured caching in memory will
    cause ever-larger memory growth), and changing the external node
    terminus to use the version of the facts as their version.  This
    will usually result in the cached node information being used,
    instead of always hitting the external node app during file
    serving. Note that if the facts aren't changed by the client,
    then this will result in the cached node being used, but at this
    point, the client always updates its facts.  (#1130)

    Fixing #1132 -- host names can now have dashes anywhere.
    (Patch by freiheit.)

    Fixing #1118 -- downloading plugins and facts now ignores noop.
    Note that this changes the behaviour a bit -- the resource's
    noop setting always beats the global setting (previously,
    whichever was true would win).

    The change in checksums from 'timestamp' to 'mtime' no longer
    result in updates on every run (#1116).

    Aliases again work in relationships (#1094).

    The CA serial file will no longer ever be owned by
    root (#1041).

    Fixing the rest of #1113: External node commands can specify
    an environment and Puppet will now use it.

    Partially fixing #1113: LDAP nodes now support environments,
    and the schema has been updated accordingly.

    Always duplicating resource defaults in the parser, so that
    stacked metaparameter values do not result in all resources
    that receive a given default also getting those stacked
    values.

0.24.2
    Fixing #1062 by moving the yamldir setting to its own yaml
    section.  This should keep the yamldir from being created
    on clients.

    Fixed #1047 -- Puppet's parser no longer changes the order
    in which statements are evaluated, which means that case
    statements can now set variables that are used by other
    variables.

    Fixed #1063 -- the master correctly logs syntax errors when
    reparsing during a single run.

    Removed the loglevels from the valid values for `logoutput`
    in the Exec resource type -- the log levels are specified
    using the `loglevel` parameter, not `logoutput`.  This never
    worked, or at least hasn`t for ages, and now the docs are
    just correct.

    Somewhat refactored fileserving so that it no longer caches
    any objects, nor does it use Puppet's RAL resources.  In the
    process, I fixed #894 (you can now copy links) and refactored
    other classes as necessary.  Mostly it was fixing tests.

    Hopefully partially fixed #1010 -- clients should now fail
    to install files whose checksums do not match the checksum
    from the server.

    Fixed #1018 -- resources now have their namevars added as
    aliases in the resource catalog, just like they were added
    in the resource classes.

    Fixed #1037 -- remote unreadable files no longer have the
    permission denied exceptions caught, thus forbidding them
    from being replaced with 'nil'.

    Fixed #1043 -- autoloading now searches the plugins directory
    in each module, in addition to the lib directory.  The 'lib'
    directory is also deprecated, but supported for now to give
    people a chance to convert.

    Fixed #1003 -- Applying DavidS's patch to fix searching for
    tags in sql.

    Fixed #992 -- Puppet is now compatible with gems 1.0.1.

    Fixed #968 again, this time with tests -- parseonly works,
    including not compiling the configurations, and also storeconfigs
    is no longer required during parse-testing.

    Fixed #1021 -- the problem was that my method of determining
    the in-degree sometimes resulted in a lower number than the
    number of in-edges.

    Fixed #997 -- virtual defined types are no longer evaluated.
    NOTE: This introduces a behaviour change, in that you previously
    could realize a resource within a virtual defined resource, and now
    you must realize the entire defined resource, rather than just
    the contained resource.

    Fixed #1030 - class and definition evaluation has been significantly
    refactored, fixing this problem and making the whole interplay
    between the classes, definitions, and nodes, and the Compile class much
    cleaner.

    Exec resources must now have unique names, although the commands can still
    be duplicated.  This is easily accomplished by just specifying a unique
    name with whatever (unique or otherwise) command you need.

    Fixed #989 -- missing CRL files are correctly ignored, and the
    value should be set to 'false' to explicitly not look for these
    files.

    Fixed #1017 -- environment-specific modulepath is no longer ignored.

    Fixing #794 -- consolidating the gentoo configuration files.

    Fixing #976 -- both the full name of qualified classes and
    the class parts are now added as tags.  I've also
    created a Tagging module that we should push throughout
    the rest of the system that uses tags.

    Fixing #995 -- puppetd no longer dies at startup if the server
    is not running.

    Fixing #977 -- the rundir is again set to 1777.

    Fixed #971 -- classes can once again be included multiple
    times.

    Added builtin support for Nagios types using
    Naginator to parse and generate the files.

0.24.1
    Updated vim filetype detection. (#900 and #963)

    Default resources like schedules no longer conflict with
    managed resources. (#965)

    Removing the ability to disable http keep-alive, since
    it didn't really work anyway and it should no longer
    be necessary.

    Refactored http keep-alive so it actually works again.
    This should be sufficient enough that we no longer need the
    ability to disable keep-alive.  There is now a central
    module responsible for managing HTTP instances, along with
    all certificates in those instances.

    Fixed a backward compatibility issue when running 0.23.x
    clients against 0.24.0 servers -- relationships would
    consistently not work. (#967)

    Closing existing http connections when opening a new one,
    and closing all connections after each run. (#961)

    Removed warning about deprecated explicit plugins mounts.

0.24.0 (misspiggy)
    Modifying the behaviour of the certdnsnames setting.  It now defaults
    to an empty string, and will only be used if it is set to something
    else.  If it is set, then the host's FQDN will also be added as
    an alias.  The default behaviour is now to add 'puppet' and
    'puppet.$domain' as DNS aliases when the name for the cert being
    signed is equal to the signing machine's name, which will only
    be the case for CA servers.  This should result in servers always
    having the alias set up and no one else, but you can still override
    the aliases if you want.

    External node support now requires that you set the 'node_terminus'
    setting to 'exec'.  See the IndirectionReference on the wiki for more
    information.

    http_enable_post_connection_check added as a configuration
    option for puppetd.  This defaults to true, which validates the server
    SSL certificate against the requested host name in new versions of ruby.
    See #896 for more information.

    Mounts no longer remount swap filesystems.

    Slightly modifying how services manage their list of paths
    (and adding documention for it).  Services now default
    to the paths specified by the provider classes.

    Removed 'type' as a valid attribute for services, since it's been
    deprecated since the creation of providers.

    Removed 'running' as a valid attribute for services, since it's
    been deprecated since February 2006.

    Added modified patch by Matt Palmer which adds a 'plugins' mount,
    fixing #891.  See PluginsInModules on the wiki for information on
    usage.

    Empty dbserver and dbpassword settings will now be ignored when
    initializing Rails connections (patch by womble).

    Configuration settings can now be blank (patch by womble).

    Added calls to endpwent/endgrent when searching for user and group IDs,
    which fixes #791.

    Obviated 'target' in interfaces, as all file paths were automatically
    calculated anyway.  The parameter is still there, but it's
    not used and just generates a warning.

    Fixing some of the problems with interface management on Red Hat.
    Puppet now uses the :netmask property and does not try to set
    the bootproto (#762).

    You now must specify an environment and you are required to specify
    the valid environments for your site. (#911) 

    Certificates now always specify a subjectAltName, but it defaults
    to '*', meaning that it doesn't require DNS names to match.  You
    can override that behaviour by specifying a value for
    'certdnsnames', which will then require that hostname as a match (#896).

    Relationship metaparams (:notify, :require, :subscribe, and
    :before) now stack when they are collecting metaparam values
    from their containers (#446).  For instance, if a resource
    inside a definition has a value set for 'require', and you call
    the definition with 'require', the resource gets both requires,
    where before it would only retain its initial value.

    Changed the behavior of --debug to include Mongrel client
    debugging information.  Mongrel output will be written to
    the terminal only, not to the puppet debug log.  This should
    help anyone working with reverse HTTP SSL proxies. (#905)

    Fixed #800 -- invalid configurations are no longer
    cached.  This was done partially by adding a relationship
    validation step once the entire configuration is created,
    but it also required the previously-mentioned changes
    to how the configuration retrieval process works.

    Removed some functionality from the Master client,
    since the local functionality has been replaced
    with the Indirector already, and rearranging how configuration
    retrieval is done to fix ordering and caching bugs.

    The node scope is now above all other scopes besides
    the 'main' scope, which should help make its variables
    visible to other classes, assuming those classes were
    not included in the node's parent.

    Replaced GRATR::Digraph with Puppet::SimpleGraph as
    the base class for Puppet's graphing.  Functionality
    should be equivalent but with dramatically better
    performance.

    The --use-nodes and --no-nodes options are now obsolete.
    Puppet automatically detects when nodes are defined, and if
    they are defined it will require that a node be found,
    else it will not look for a node nor will it fail if it
    fails to find one.

    Fixed #832. Added the '--no-daemonize' option to puppetd and
    puppetmasterd.  NOTE: The default behavior of 'verbose' and
    'debug' no longer cause puppetd and puppetmasterd to not
    daemonize.

    Added k5login type. (#759)

    Fixed CA race condition. (#693)

    Added shortname support to config.rb and refactored addargs

0.23.2
    Fixed the problem in cron jobs where environment settings
    tended to multiple. (#749)

    Collection of resources now correctly only collects exported
    resources again.  This was broken in 0.23.0. (#731)

    'gen_config' now generates a configuration with
    all parameters under a heading that matches the
    process name, rather than keeping section headings.

    Refactored how the parser and interpreter relate,
    so parsing is now effectively an atomic process (thus
    fixing #314 and #729).  This makes the interpreter less
    prone to error and less prone to show the error to the
    clients.  Note that this means that if a configuration
    fails to parse, then the previous, parseable configuration
    will be used instead, so the client will not know that
    the configuration failed to parse.

    Added support for managing interfaces, thanks to work
    by Paul Rose.

    Fixed #652, thanks to a patch by emerose; --fqdn again
    works with puppetd.

    Added an extra check to the Mongrel support so that
    Apache can be used with optional cert checking, instead
    of mandatory, thus allowing Mongrel to function as the CA.
    This is thanks to work done by Marcin Owsiany.

0.23.1 (beaker)
    You can now specify relationships to classes, which work
    exactly like relationships to defined types:
        require => Class[myclass]
    This works with qualified classes, too.

    You can now do simple queries in a collection of
    exported resources.  You still cannot do multi-condition queries,
    though. (#703)

    puppetca now exits with a non-zero code if it cannot
    find any host certificates to clean. (Patch by Dean
    Wilson.)

    Fully-qualified resources can now have defaults. (#589)

    Resource references can now be fully-qualified names,
    meaning you can list definitions with a namespace as
    dependencies.  (#468)

    Files modified using a FileType instance, as ParsedFile
    does, will now automatically get backed up to the filebucket
    named "puppet".

    Added a 'maillist' type for managing mailing lists.

    Added a 'mailalias' type for managing mail aliases.

    Added patch by Valentin Vidic that adds the '+>' syntax to
    resources, so parameter values can be added to.

    The configuration client now pulls libraries down to $libdir,
    and all autoloading is done from there with full support
    for any reloadable file, such as types and providers. (#621)
    Note that this is not backward compatible -- if you're using
    pluginsync right now, you'll need to disable it on your clients
    until you can upgrade them.

    The Rails log level can now be set via (shockingly!) the
    'rails_loglevel' parameter (#710).  Note that this isn't
    exactly the feature asked for, but I could not find a
    way to directly copy ActiveRecord's concept of an environment.

    External node sources can now return undefined classes (#687). 

    Puppet clients now have http proxy support (#701).

    The parser now throws an error when a resource reference
    is created for an unknown type.  Also, resource references
    look up defined types and translate their type accordingly. (#706)

    Hostnames can now be double quoted.

    Adding module autoloading (#596) -- you can now 'include' classes
    from modules without ever needing to specifically load them.

    Class names and node names now conflict (#620).

0.23.0
    Modified the fileserver to cache file information, so that
    each file isn't being read on every connection.  Also,
    added londo's patch from #678 to avoid reading entire files
    into memory.

    Fixed environment handling in the crontab provider (#669).

    Added patch by trombik in #572, supporting old-style
    freebsd init scripts with '.sh' endings.

    Added fink package provider (#642), as provided by 'do'.

    Marked the dpkg package provider as versionable (#647).

    Applied patches by trombik to fix FreeBSD ports (#624 and #628).

    Fixed the CA server so that it refuses to send back a certificate
    whose public key doesn't match the CSR.  Instead, it tells the
    user to run 'puppetca --clean'.

    Invalid certificates are no longer written to disk (#578).

    Added a package provider (appdmg) able to install .app packages
    on .dmg files on OS X (#641).

    Applied the patch from #667 to hopefully kill the client hanging
    problems (permanently, this time).

    Fixed functions so that they accept most other rvalues as valid values
    (#548).

    COMPATIBILITY ALERT:
    Significantly reworked external node support, in a way that's NOT
    backward-compatible:

        Only ONE node source can be used -- you can use LDAP, code, or
        an external node program, but not more than one.
    
        LDAP node support has two changes:  First, the "ldapattrs" attribute is
        now used for setting the attributes to retrieve from the server (in
        addition to required attriutes), and second, all retrieved attributes
        are set as variables in the top scope.  This means you can set attributes
        on your LDAP nodes and they will automatically appear as variables
        in your configurations.

        External node support has been completely rewritten.  These programs must
        now generate a YAML dump of a hash, with "classes" and "parameters" keys.
        The classes should be an array, and the parameters should be a hash.  The
        external node program has no support for parent nodes -- the script must
        handle that on its own.

    Reworked the database schema used to store configurations with the
    storeconfigs option.  
    
    Replaced the obsolete RRD ruby library with the maintained
    RubyRRDtool library (which requires rrdtool2) (#659).

    The Portage package provider now calls eix-update automatically
    when eix's database is absent or out of sync (#666).

    Mounts now correctly handle existing fstabs with no pass or dump values
    (#550).

    Mounts now default to 0 for pass and dump (#112).

    Added urpmi support (#592).

    Finishing up the type => provider interface work.  Basically, package
    providers now return lists of provider instances.  In the proces,
    I rewrote the interface between package types and providers, and also
    enabled prefetching on all packages.  This should significantly speed
    up most package operations.

    Hopefully fixing the file descriptor/open port problems, with patches
    from Valentin Vidic.

    Significantly reworked the type => provider interface with respect to
    listing existing provider instances.  The class method on both
    class heirarchies has been renamed to 'instances', to start.  Providers
    are now expected to return provider instances, instead of creating
    resources, and the resource's 'instances' method is expected to
    find the matching resource, if any, and set the resource's
    provider appropriately.  This *significantly* reduces the reliance on
    effectively global state (resource references in the resource classes).
    This global state will go away soon.

    Along with this change, the 'prefetch' class method on providers now
    accepts the list of resources for prefetching.  This again reduces
    reliance on global state, and makes the execution path much easier
    to follow.

    Fixed #532 -- reparsing config files now longer throws an exception.

    Added some warnings and logs to the service type so
    users will be encouraged to specify either "ensure"
    or "enabled" and added debugging to indicate why
    restarting is skipped when it is.

    Changed the location of the classes.txt to the state
    directory.

    Added better error reporting on unmatched brackets.

    Moved puppetd and puppetmasterd to sbin in svn and fixed install.rb
    to copy them into sbin on the local system appropriately.  (#323)

    Added a splay option (#501).  It's disabled when running under
    --test in puppetd.  The value is random but cached.  It defaults
    to the runinterval but can be tuned with --splaylimit

    Changing the notify type so that it always uses
    the loglevel.

    Fixing #568 - nodes can inherit from quoted node names.

    Tags (and thus definitions and classes) can now be a single
    character. (#566)

    Added an 'undef' keyword (#629), which will evaluate to ""
    within strings but when used as a resource parameter value
    will cause that parameter to be evaluated as undefined.

    Changed the topological sort algorithm (#507) so it will always
    fail on cycles.

    Added a 'dynamicfacts' configuration option; any facts in that
    comma-separated list will be ignored when comparing facts to 
    see if they have changed and thus whether a recompile is necessary.

    Renamed some poorly named internal variables:
        @models in providers are now either @resource or
        @resource_type (#605).

        @children is no longer used except by components (#606).

        @parent is now @resource within parameters (#607).

    The old variables are still set for backward compatibility.

    Significantly reworking configuration parsing.  Executables all now
    look for 'puppet.conf' (#206), although they will parse the old-style
    configuration files if they are present, although they throw a deprecation
    warning.  Also, file parameters (owner, mode, group) are now set on the
    same line as the parameter, in brackets. (#422)

    Added transaction summaries (available with the --summarize option),
    useful for getting a quick idea of what happened in a transaction.
    Currently only useful on the client or with the puppet interpreter.

    Changed the interal workings for retrieve and removed the :is attribute
    from Property.  The retrieve methods now return the current value of
    the property for the system.

    Removed acts_as_taggable from the rails models.

0.22.4
    Execs now autorequire the user they run as, as long as the user
    is specified by name. (#430)

    Files on the local machine but not on the remote server during
    a source copy are now purged if purge => true. (#594)

    Providers can now specify that some commands are optional (#585).
    Also, the 'command' method returns nil on missing commands,
    rather than throwing an error, so the presence of commands
    be tested.

    The 'useradd' provider for Users can now manage passwords.
    No other providers can, at this point.

    Parameters can now declare a dependency on specific
    features, and parameters that require missing features
    will not be instantiated.  This is most useful for
    properties.

    FileParsing classes can now use instance_eval to add
    many methods at once to a record type.

    Modules no longer return directories in the list of found
    manifests (#588).

    The crontab provider now defaults to root when there is no
    USER set in the environment.

    Puppetd once again correctly responds to HUP.

    Added a syntax for referring to variables defined in
    other classes (e.g., $puppet::server).

    STDIN, STDOUT, STDERR are now redirected to /dev/null in
    service providers descending from base.

    Certificates are now valid starting one day before they are
    created, to help handle small amounts of clock skew.

    Files are no longer considered out of sync if some properties
    are out of sync but they have no properties that can create
    the file.

0.22.3
    Fixed backward compatibility for logs and metrics from older clients.

    Fixed the location of the authconfig parameters so there aren't
    loading order issues.

    Enabling attribute validation on the providers that subclass
    'nameservice', so we can verify that an integer is passed to
    UID and GID.

    Added a stand-alone filebucket client, named 'filebucket'.

    Fixed the new nested paths for filebuckets; the entire md5 sum was
    not being stored.

    Fixing #553; -M is no longer added when home directories are being
    managed on Red Hat.

0.22.2 (grover)
    Users can now manage their home directories, using the managehome
    parameter, partially using patches provided by Tim Stoop and
    Matt Palmer. (#432)

    Added 'ralsh' (formerly x2puppet) to the svn tree.  When possible it
    should be added to the packages.

    The 'notify' type now defaults to its message being the same as its name.

    Reopening $stdin to read from /dev/null during execution, in hopes that
    init scripts will stop hanging.

    Changed the 'servername' fact set on the server to use the server's fqdn,
    instead of the short-name.

    Changing the location of the configuration cache.  It now defaults to being
    in the state directory, rather than in the configuration directory.

    All parameter instances are stored in a single @parameters instance variable
    hash within resource type instances.  We used to use separate hashes for
    each parameter type.

    Added the concept of provider features.  Eventually these should be able
    to express the full range of provider functionality, but for now they can
    test a provider to see what methods it has set and determine what features it
    provides as a result.  These features are integrated into the doc generation
    system so that you get feature documentation automatically.

    Switched apt/aptitide to using "apt-cache policy" instead of "apt-cache showpkg"
    for determining the latest available version. (#487)

    FileBuckets now use a deeply nested structure for storing files, so
    you do not end up with hundreds or thousands of files in the same
    directory. (#447)

    Facts are now cached in the state file, and when they change the configuration
    is always recompiled. (#519)

    Added 'ignoreimport' setting for use in commit hooks.  This causes the
    parser to ignore import statements so a single file can be parse-checked.  (#544)

    Import statements can now specify multiple comma-separated arguments.

    Definitions now support both 'name' and 'title', just like any other
    resource type. (#539)

    Added a generate() command, which sets values to the result of an external
    command. (#541)

    Added a file() command to read in files with no interpolation.  The first
    found file has its content returned.

    puppetd now exits if no cert is present in onetime mode. (#533)

    The client configuration cache can be safely removed and the client
    will correctly realize the client is not in sync.

    Resources can now be freely deleted, thus fixing many problems introduced
    when deletion of required resources was forbidden when purging was introduced.
    Only resources being purged will not be deleted.

    Facts and plugins now download even in noop mode (#540).

    Resources in noop mode now log when they would have responded to an event (#542).

    Refactored cron support entirely.  Cron now uses providers, and there
    is a single 'crontab' provider that handles user crontabs.  While this
    refactor does not include providers for /etc/crontab or cron.d, it should
    now be straightforward to write those providers.

    Changed the parameter sorting so that the provider parameter comes
    right after name, so the provider is available when the other parameters
    and properties are being created.

    Redid some of the internals of the ParsedFile provider base class.
    It now passes a FileRecord around instead of a hash.

    Fixing a bug related to link recursion that caused link directories
    to always be considered out of sync.

    The bind address for puppetmasterd can now be specified with 
    --bindaddress.

    Added (probably experimental) mongrel support.  At this point you're
    still responsible for starting each individual process, and you have to
    set up a proxy in front of it.

    Redesigned the 'network' tree to support multiple web servers, including
    refactoring most of the structural code so it's much clearer and more
    reusable now.

    Set up the CA client to default to ca_server and ca_port, so you can
    easily run a separate CA.

    Supporting hosts with no domain name, thanks to a patch from
    Dennis Jacobfeuerborn.

    Added an 'ignorecache' option to tell puppetd to force a recompile, thanks to
    a patch by Chris McEniry.

    Made up2date the default for RHEL < 4 and yum the default for the rest.

    The yum provider now supports versions.

    Case statements correctly match when multiple values are provided,
    thanks to a patch by David Schmitt.

    Functions can now be called with no arguments.

    String escapes parse correctly in all cases now, thanks to a patch by
    cstorey.

    Subclasses again search parent classes for defaults.

    You can now purge apt and dpkg packages.

    When doing file recursion, 'ensure' only affects the top-level directory.

    States have been renamed to Properties.

0.22.1 (kermit) -- Mostly a bugfix release
    Compile times now persist between restarts of puppetd.

    Timeouts have been added to many parts of Puppet, reducing the likelihood
    if it hanging forever on broken scripts or servers.

    All of the documentation and recipes have been moved to the wiki by Peter
    Abrahamsen and Ben Kite has moved the FAQ to the wiki.

    Explicit relationships now override automatic relationships, allowing you
    to manually specify deletion order when removing resources.

    Resources with dependencies can now be deleted as long as all of their
    dependencies are also being deleted.

    Namespaces for both classes and definitions now work much more consistently.
    You should now be able to specify a class or definition with a namespace
    everywhere you would normally expect to be able to specify one without.

    Downcasing of facts can be selectively disabled.

    Cyclic dependency graphs are now checked for and forbidden.

    The netinfo mounts provider was commented out, because it really doesn't
    work at all.  Stupid NetInfo stores mount information with the device as
    the key, which doesn't work with my current NetInfo code.

    Otherwise, lots and lots of bugfixes.  Check the tickets associated with the
    'kermit' milestone.

0.22.0
    Integrated the GRATR graph library into Puppet, for handling resource
    relationships.

    Lots of bug-fixes (see bugs tickets associated with the 'minor' milestone).

    Added new 'resources' metatype, which currently only includes the ability
    to purge unmanaged resources.

    Added better ability to generate new resource objects during transactions
    (using 'generate' and 'eval_generate' methods).

    Rewrote all Rails support with a much better database design.  Export/collect
    now works, although the database is incompatible with previous versions.

    Removed downcasing of facts and made most of the language case-insensitive.

    Added support for printing the graphs built during transactions.

    Reworked how paths are built for logging.

    Switched all providers to directly executing commands instead of going through
    a subshell, which removes the need to quote or escape arguments.

0.20.1
    Mostly a bug-fix release, with the most important fix being the
    multiple-definition error.

    Completely rewrote the ParsedFile system; each provider is now much
    shorter and much more maintainable.  However, fundamental problems
    were found with the 'port' type, so it was disabled.  Also, added
    a NetInfo provider for 'host' and an experimental NetInfo provider
    for 'mount'.

    Made the RRDGraph report *much* better and added reference
    generation for reports and functions.

0.20.0
    Significantly refactored the parser.  Resource overrides now consistently
    work anywhere in a class hierarchy.

    The language was also modified somewhat.  The previous export/collect syntax
    is now used for handling virtual objects, and export/collect (which is still
    experimental) now uses double sigils (@@ and <<| |>>).

    Resource references (e.g., File["/etc/passwd"]) now have to be capitalized,
    in fitting in with capitalizing type operations.

    As usual, lots of other smaller fixes, but most of the work was in the language.

0.19.3
    Fixing a bug in server/master.rb that causes the hostname
    not to be available in locally-executed manifests.

0.19.2
    Fixing a few smaller bugs, notably in the reports system.

    Refreshed objects now generate an event, which can result in further
    refreshes of other objects.

0.19.1
    Fixing two critical bugs:  User management works again and cron jobs are
    no longer added to all user accounts.

0.19.0
    Added provider support.

    Added support for %h, %H, and %d expansion in fileserver.conf.

    Added Certificate Revocation support.

    Made dynamic loading pervasive -- nearly every aspect of Puppet will now
    automatically load new instances (e.g., types, providers, and reports).

    Added support for automatic distribution of facts and plugins (custom types).

0.18.4
    Another bug-fix release.  The most import bug fixed is that
    cronjobs again work even with initially empty crontabs.

0.18.3
    Mostly a bug-fix release; fixed small bugs in the functionality added in
    0.18.2.

0.18.2
    Added templating support.

    Added reporting.

    Added gem and blastwave packaging support.

0.18.1
    Added signal handlers for HUP, so both client and server deal correctly with it.

    Added signal handler for USR1, which triggers a run on the client.

    As usual, fixed many bugs.

    Significant fixes to puppetrun -- it should behave much more correctly now.

    Added "fail" function which throws a syntax error if it's encountered.

    Added plugin downloading from the central server to the client.  It must be
    enabled with --pluginsync.

    Added support for FreeBSD's special "@daily" cron schedules.

    Correctly handling spaces in file sources.

    Moved documentation into svn tree.
    
0.18.0
    Added support for a "default" node.

    When multiple nodes are specified, they must now be comma-separated (this
    introduces a language incompatibility).

    Failed dependencies cause dependent objects within the same transaction
    not to run.

    Many updates to puppetrun

    Many bug fixes

    Function names are no longer reserved words.

    Links can now replace files.

0.17.2
    Added "puppetrun" application and associated runner server and client classes.

    Fixed cron support so it better supports valid values and environment settings.

0.17.1
    Fixing a bug requiring rails on all Debian boxes

    Fixing a couple of other small bugs

0.17.0
    Adding ActiveRecord integration on the server

    Adding export/collect functionality

    Fixing many bugs

0.16.5
    Fixing a critical bug in importing classes from other files

    Fixing nodename handling to actually allow dashes

0.16.4
    Fixing a critical bug in puppetd when acquiring a certificate for the first
    time

0.16.3
    Some significant bug fixes

    Modified puppetd so that it can now function as an agent independent
    of a puppetmasterd process, e.g., using the PuppetShow web application.

0.16.2
    Modified some of the AST classes so that class names, definition names, and
    node names are all set within the code being evaluated, so 'tagged(name)' returns
    true while evaluating 'name', for instance.

    Added '--clean' argument to puppetca to remove all traces of a given
    client.

0.16.1
    Added 'tagged' and 'defined' functions.

    Moved all functions to a general framework that makes it very easy to add new
    functions.

0.16.0
    Added 'tag' keyword/function.

    Added FreeBSD Ports support

    Added 'pelement' server for sending or receiving Puppet objects, although
    none of the executables use it yet.

0.15.3
    Fixed many bugs in :exec, including adding support for arrays of checks

    Added autoloading for types and service variants (e.g., you can now
    just create a new type in the appropriate location and use it in Puppet,
    without modifying the core Puppet libs).

0.15.2
    Added darwinport, Apple .pkg, and freebsd package types
    Added 'mount type
    Host facts are now set at the top scope (Bug #103)
    Added -e (inline exection) flag to 'puppet' executable
    Many small bug fixes

0.15.1
    Fixed 'yum' installs so that they successfully upgrade packages.
    Fixed puppetmasterd.conf file so group settings take.

0.15.0
    Upped the minor release because the File server is incompatible with 0.14,
        because it now handles links.

    The 'symlink' type is deprecated (but still present), in favor of using
        files with the 'target' parameter.

    Unset variables no longer throw an error, they just return an empty string

    You can now specify tags to restrict which objects run during a given run.

    You can also specify to skip running against the cached copy when there's
    a failure, which is useful for testing new configurations.

    RPMs and Sun packages can now install, as long as they specify a package
        location, and they'll automatically upgrade if you point them to a new
        file with an upgrade.
    Multiple bug fixes.
