.TH "PUPPET\-CERTIFICATE_REVOCATION_LIST" "8" "May 2018" "Puppet, Inc." "Puppet manual"
.
.SH "NAME"
\fBpuppet\-certificate_revocation_list\fR \- Manage the list of revoked certificates\.
.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
puppet certificate_revocation_list \fIaction\fR [\-\-terminus _TERMINUS] [\-\-extra HASH]
.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This subcommand is primarily for retrieving the certificate revocation list from the CA\.
.
.SH "OPTIONS"
Note that any setting that\'s valid in the configuration file is also a valid long argument, although it may or may not be relevant to the present action\. For example, \fBserver\fR and \fBrun_mode\fR are valid settings, so you can specify \fB\-\-server <servername>\fR, or \fB\-\-run_mode <runmode>\fR as an argument\.
.
.P
See the configuration file documentation at \fIhttps://docs\.puppetlabs\.com/puppet/latest/reference/configuration\.html\fR for the full list of acceptable parameters\. A commented list of all configuration options can also be generated by running puppet with \fB\-\-genconfig\fR\.
.
.TP
\-\-render\-as FORMAT
The format in which to render output\. The most common formats are \fBjson\fR, \fBs\fR (string), \fByaml\fR, and \fBconsole\fR, but other options such as \fBdot\fR are sometimes available\.
.
.TP
\-\-verbose
Whether to log verbosely\.
.
.TP
\-\-debug
Whether to log debug information\.
.
.TP
\-\-extra HASH
A terminus can take additional arguments to refine the operation, which are passed as an arbitrary hash to the back\-end\. Anything passed as the extra value is just send direct to the back\-end\.
.
.TP
\-\-terminus _TERMINUS
Indirector faces expose indirected subsystems of Puppet\. These subsystems are each able to retrieve and alter a specific type of data (with the familiar actions of \fBfind\fR, \fBsearch\fR, \fBsave\fR, and \fBdestroy\fR) from an arbitrary number of pluggable backends\. In Puppet parlance, these backends are called terminuses\.
.
.IP
Almost all indirected subsystems have a \fBrest\fR terminus that interacts with the puppet master\'s data\. Most of them have additional terminuses for various local data models, which are in turn used by the indirected subsystem on the puppet master whenever it receives a remote request\.
.
.IP
The terminus for an action is often determined by context, but occasionally needs to be set explicitly\. See the "Notes" section of this face\'s manpage for more details\.
.
.SH "ACTIONS"
.
.TP
\fBdestroy\fR \- Delete the certificate revocation list\.
\fBSYNOPSIS\fR
.
.IP
puppet certificate_revocation_list destroy [\-\-terminus _TERMINUS] [\-\-extra HASH] \fIdummy_text\fR
.
.IP
\fBDESCRIPTION\fR
.
.IP
Deletes the certificate revocation list\. This cannot be done over REST, but it is possible to delete the locally cached copy or the local CA\'s copy of the CRL\.
.
.IP
\fBRETURNS\fR
.
.IP
Nothing\.
.
.IP
\fBNOTES\fR
.
.IP
Although this action always deletes the CRL from the specified terminus, it requires a dummy argument; this is a known bug\.
.
.TP
\fBfind\fR \- Retrieve the certificate revocation list\.
\fBSYNOPSIS\fR
.
.IP
puppet certificate_revocation_list find [\-\-terminus _TERMINUS] [\-\-extra HASH] [\fIkey\fR]
.
.IP
\fBDESCRIPTION\fR
.
.IP
Retrieve the certificate revocation list\.
.
.IP
\fBRETURNS\fR
.
.IP
The certificate revocation list\. When used from the Ruby API: returns an OpenSSL::X509::CRL object\.
.
.IP
\fBNOTES\fR
.
.IP
Although this action always returns the CRL from the specified terminus\.
.
.TP
\fBinfo\fR \- Print the default terminus class for this face\.
\fBSYNOPSIS\fR
.
.IP
puppet certificate_revocation_list info [\-\-terminus _TERMINUS] [\-\-extra HASH]
.
.IP
\fBDESCRIPTION\fR
.
.IP
Prints the default terminus class for this subcommand\. Note that different run modes may have different default termini; when in doubt, specify the run mode with the \'\-\-run_mode\' option\.
.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
\fBfind\fR
.
.P
Retrieve a copy of the puppet master\'s CRL:
.
.P
$ puppet certificate_revocation_list find \-\-terminus rest
.
.SH "NOTES"
This subcommand is an indirector face, which exposes \fBfind\fR, \fBsearch\fR, \fBsave\fR, and \fBdestroy\fR actions for an indirected subsystem of Puppet\. Valid termini for this face include:
