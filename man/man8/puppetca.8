.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Because the puppetmasterd daemon defaults to not signing client
certificate requests, this script is available for signing outstanding
requests. It can be used to list outstanding requests and then either
sign them individually or sign all of them.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
Note that any configuration parameter that\(aqs valid in the configuration
file is also a valid long argument. For example, \(aqssldir\(aq is a valid
configuration parameter, so you can specify \(aq\-\-ssldir <directory>\(aq as an
argument.
.sp
See the configuration file documentation at
\fI\%http://reductivelabs.com/projects/puppet/reference/configref.html\fP for
the full list of acceptable parameters. A commented list of all
configuration options can also be generated by running puppetca with
\(aq\-\-genconfig\(aq.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B all:      Operate on all items. Currently only makes sense with
.
\(aq\-\-sign\(aq, \(aq\-\-clean\(aq, or \(aq\-\-list\(aq.
.TP
.B clean:    Remove all files related to a host from puppetca\(aqs storage.
.
This is useful when rebuilding hosts, since new certificate
signing requests will only be honored if puppetca does not
have a copy of a signed certificate for that host. The
certificate of the host remains valid. If \(aq\-\-all\(aq is specified
then all host certificates, both signed and unsigned, will be
removed.
.UNINDENT
.sp
debug:    Enable full debugging.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B generate: Generate a certificate for a named client. A
.
certificate/keypair will be generated for each client named on
the command line.
.UNINDENT
.sp
help:     Print this help message
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B list:     List outstanding certificate requests. If \(aq\-\-all\(aq is
.
specified, signed certificates are also listed, prefixed by
\(aq+\(aq, and revoked or invalid certificates are prefixed by \(aq\-\(aq
(the verification outcome is printed in parenthesis).
.UNINDENT
.sp
print:    Print the full\-text version of a host\(aqs certificate.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B revoke:   Revoke the certificate of a client. The certificate can be
.
specified either by its serial number, given as a decimal
number or a hexadecimal number prefixed by \(aq0x\(aq, or by its
hostname. The certificate is revoked by adding it to the
Certificate Revocation List given by the \(aqcacrl\(aq config
parameter. Note that the puppetmasterd needs to be restarted
after revoking certificates.
.TP
.B sign:     Sign an outstanding certificate request. Unless \(aq\-\-all\(aq is
.
specified, hosts must be listed after all flags.
.UNINDENT
.sp
verbose:  Enable verbosity.
.sp
version:  Print the puppet version number and exit.
.sp
verify:   Verify the named certificate against the local CA certificate.
