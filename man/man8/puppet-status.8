.TH "PUPPET\-STATUS" "8" "May 2015" "Puppet Labs, LLC" "Puppet manual"
.
.SH "NAME"
\fBpuppet\-status\fR \- View puppet server status\.
.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
puppet status \fIaction\fR [\-\-terminus TERMINUS] [\-\-extra HASH]
.
.SH "OPTIONS"
Note that any setting that\'s valid in the configuration file is also a valid long argument, although it may or may not be relevant to the present action\. For example, \fBserver\fR and \fBrun_mode\fR are valid settings, so you can specify \fB\-\-server <servername>\fR, or \fB\-\-run_mode <runmode>\fR as an argument\.
.
.P
See the configuration file documentation at \fIhttps://docs\.puppetlabs\.com/references/stable/configuration\.html\fR for the full list of acceptable parameters\. A commented list of all configuration options can also be generated by running puppet with \fB\-\-genconfig\fR\.
.
.TP
\-\-render\-as FORMAT
The format in which to render output\. The most common formats are \fBjson\fR, \fBs\fR (string), \fByaml\fR, and \fBconsole\fR, but other options such as \fBdot\fR are sometimes available\.
.
.TP
\-\-verbose
Whether to log verbosely\.
.
.TP
\-\-debug
Whether to log debug information\.
.
.TP
\-\-extra HASH
A terminus can take additional arguments to refine the operation, which are passed as an arbitrary hash to the back\-end\. Anything passed as the extra value is just send direct to the back\-end\.
.
.TP
\-\-terminus TERMINUS
Indirector faces expose indirected subsystems of Puppet\. These subsystems are each able to retrieve and alter a specific type of data (with the familiar actions of \fBfind\fR, \fBsearch\fR, \fBsave\fR, and \fBdestroy\fR) from an arbitrary number of pluggable backends\. In Puppet parlance, these backends are called terminuses\.
.
.IP
Almost all indirected subsystems have a \fBrest\fR terminus that interacts with the puppet master\'s data\. Most of them have additional terminuses for various local data models, which are in turn used by the indirected subsystem on the puppet master whenever it receives a remote request\.
.
.IP
The terminus for an action is often determined by context, but occasionally needs to be set explicitly\. See the "Notes" section of this face\'s manpage for more details\.
.
.SH "ACTIONS"
.
.TP
\fBfind\fR \- Check status of puppet master server\.
\fBSYNOPSIS\fR
.
.IP
puppet status [\-\-terminus TERMINUS] [\-\-extra HASH] [\fIkey\fR]
.
.IP
\fBDESCRIPTION\fR
.
.IP
Checks whether a Puppet server is properly receiving and processing HTTP requests\. This action is only useful when used with \'\-\-terminus rest\'; when invoked with the \fBlocal\fR terminus, \fBfind\fR will always return true\.
.
.IP
Over REST, this action will query the configured puppet master by default\. To query other servers, including puppet agent nodes started with the \fI\-\-listen\fR option, you can set the global \fI\-\-server\fR and \fI\-\-masterport\fR options on the command line; note that agent nodes listen on port 8139\.
.
.IP
\fBRETURNS\fR
.
.IP
A "true" response or a low\-level connection error\. When used from the Ruby API: returns a Puppet::Status object\.
.
.IP
\fBNOTES\fR
.
.IP
This action requires that the server\'s \fBauth\.conf\fR file allow find access to the \fBstatus\fR REST terminus\. Puppet agent does not use this facility, and it is turned off by default\. See \fIhttps://docs\.puppetlabs\.com/guides/rest_auth_conf\.html\fR for more details\.
.
.TP
\fBinfo\fR \- Print the default terminus class for this face\.
\fBSYNOPSIS\fR
.
.IP
puppet status info [\-\-terminus TERMINUS] [\-\-extra HASH]
.
.IP
\fBDESCRIPTION\fR
.
.IP
Prints the default terminus class for this subcommand\. Note that different run modes may have different default termini; when in doubt, specify the run mode with the \'\-\-run_mode\' option\.
.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
\fBfind\fR
.
.P
Check the status of the configured puppet master:
.
.P
$ puppet status find \-\-terminus rest
.
.SH "NOTES"
This subcommand is an indirector face, which exposes \fBfind\fR, \fBsearch\fR, \fBsave\fR, and \fBdestroy\fR actions for an indirected subsystem of Puppet\. Valid termini for this face include:
