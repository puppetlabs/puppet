.
.SH "NAME"
\fBpuppet\-report\fR \- Create, display, and submit reports\.
.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
puppet report \fIaction\fR [\-\-terminus TERMINUS] [\-\-extra HASH]
.
.SH "OPTIONS"
Note that any setting that\'s valid in the configuration file is also a valid long argument, although it may or may not be relevant to the present action\. For example, \fBserver\fR and \fBrun_mode\fR are valid settings, so you can specify \fB\-\-server <servername>\fR, or \fB\-\-run_mode <runmode>\fR as an argument\.
.
.P
See the configuration file documentation at \fIhttps://docs\.puppetlabs\.com/references/stable/configuration\.html\fR for the full list of acceptable parameters\. A commented list of all configuration options can also be generated by running puppet with \fB\-\-genconfig\fR\.
.
.TP
\-\-render\-as FORMAT
The format in which to render output\. The most common formats are \fBjson\fR, \fBs\fR (string), \fByaml\fR, and \fBconsole\fR, but other options such as \fBdot\fR are sometimes available\.
.
.TP
\-\-verbose
Whether to log verbosely\.
.
.TP
\-\-debug
Whether to log debug information\.
.
.TP
\-\-extra HASH
A terminus can take additional arguments to refine the operation, which are passed as an arbitrary hash to the back\-end\. Anything passed as the extra value is just send direct to the back\-end\.
.
.TP
\-\-terminus TERMINUS
Indirector faces expose indirected subsystems of Puppet\. These subsystems are each able to retrieve and alter a specific type of data (with the familiar actions of \fBfind\fR, \fBsearch\fR, \fBsave\fR, and \fBdestroy\fR) from an arbitrary number of pluggable backends\. In Puppet parlance, these backends are called terminuses\.
.
.IP
Almost all indirected subsystems have a \fBrest\fR terminus that interacts with the puppet master\'s data\. Most of them have additional terminuses for various local data models, which are in turn used by the indirected subsystem on the puppet master whenever it receives a remote request\.
.
.IP
The terminus for an action is often determined by context, but occasionally needs to be set explicitly\. See the "Notes" section of this face\'s manpage for more details\.
.
.SH "ACTIONS"
.
.TP
\fBinfo\fR \- Print the default terminus class for this face\.
\fBSYNOPSIS\fR
.
.IP
puppet report info [\-\-terminus TERMINUS] [\-\-extra HASH]
.
.IP
\fBDESCRIPTION\fR
.
.IP
Prints the default terminus class for this subcommand\. Note that different run modes may have different default termini; when in doubt, specify the run mode with the \'\-\-run_mode\' option\.
.
.TP
\fBsave\fR \- API only: submit a report\.
\fBSYNOPSIS\fR
.
.IP
puppet report save [\-\-terminus TERMINUS] [\-\-extra HASH] \fIreport\fR
.
.IP
\fBDESCRIPTION\fR
.
.IP
API only: create or overwrite an object\. As the Faces framework does not currently accept data from STDIN, save actions cannot currently be invoked from the command line\.
.
.IP
\fBRETURNS\fR
.
.IP
Nothing\.
.
.TP
\fBsubmit\fR \- API only: submit a report with error handling\.
\fBSYNOPSIS\fR
.
.IP
puppet report submit [\-\-terminus TERMINUS] [\-\-extra HASH] \fIreport\fR
.
.IP
\fBDESCRIPTION\fR
.
.IP
API only: Submits a report to the puppet master\. This action is essentially a shortcut and wrapper for the \fBsave\fR action with the \fBrest\fR terminus, and provides additional details in the event of a failure\.
.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
\fBsave\fR
.
.P
From the implementation of \fBpuppet report submit\fR (API example):
.
.P
begin Puppet::Transaction::Report\.indirection\.terminus_class = :rest Puppet::Face[:report, "0\.0\.1"]\.save(report) Puppet\.notice "Uploaded report for #{report\.name}" rescue => detail Puppet\.log_exception(detail, "Could not send report: #{detail}") end
.
.P
\fBsubmit\fR
.
.P
API example:report = Puppet::Face[:catalog, \'0\.0\.1\']\.apply Puppet::Face[:report, \'0\.0\.1\']\.submit(report) return report
.
.SH "NOTES"
This subcommand is an indirector face, which exposes \fBfind\fR, \fBsearch\fR, \fBsave\fR, and \fBdestroy\fR actions for an indirected subsystem of Puppet\. Valid termini for this face include:
