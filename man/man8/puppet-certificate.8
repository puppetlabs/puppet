.
.SH "NAME"
\fBpuppet\-certificate\fR \- Provide access to the CA for certificate management\.
.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
puppet certificate \fIaction\fR [\-\-terminus TERMINUS] [\-\-extra HASH] \fI\-\-ca\-location LOCATION\fR
.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This subcommand interacts with a local or remote Puppet certificate authority\. Currently, its behavior is not a full superset of \fBpuppet cert\fR; specifically, it is unable to mimic puppet cert\'s "clean" option, and its "generate" action submits a CSR rather than creating a signed certificate\.
.
.SH "OPTIONS"
Note that any setting that\'s valid in the configuration file is also a valid long argument, although it may or may not be relevant to the present action\. For example, \fBserver\fR and \fBrun_mode\fR are valid settings, so you can specify \fB\-\-server <servername>\fR, or \fB\-\-run_mode <runmode>\fR as an argument\.
.
.P
See the configuration file documentation at \fIhttps://docs\.puppetlabs\.com/references/stable/configuration\.html\fR for the full list of acceptable parameters\. A commented list of all configuration options can also be generated by running puppet with \fB\-\-genconfig\fR\.
.
.TP
\-\-render\-as FORMAT
The format in which to render output\. The most common formats are \fBjson\fR, \fBs\fR (string), \fByaml\fR, and \fBconsole\fR, but other options such as \fBdot\fR are sometimes available\.
.
.TP
\-\-verbose
Whether to log verbosely\.
.
.TP
\-\-debug
Whether to log debug information\.
.
.TP
\-\-ca\-location LOCATION
Whether to act on the local certificate authority or one provided by a remote puppet master\. Allowed values are \'local\' and \'remote\.\'
.
.IP
This option is required\.
.
.TP
\-\-extra HASH
A terminus can take additional arguments to refine the operation, which are passed as an arbitrary hash to the back\-end\. Anything passed as the extra value is just send direct to the back\-end\.
.
.TP
\-\-terminus TERMINUS
Indirector faces expose indirected subsystems of Puppet\. These subsystems are each able to retrieve and alter a specific type of data (with the familiar actions of \fBfind\fR, \fBsearch\fR, \fBsave\fR, and \fBdestroy\fR) from an arbitrary number of pluggable backends\. In Puppet parlance, these backends are called terminuses\.
.
.IP
Almost all indirected subsystems have a \fBrest\fR terminus that interacts with the puppet master\'s data\. Most of them have additional terminuses for various local data models, which are in turn used by the indirected subsystem on the puppet master whenever it receives a remote request\.
.
.IP
The terminus for an action is often determined by context, but occasionally needs to be set explicitly\. See the "Notes" section of this face\'s manpage for more details\.
.
.SH "ACTIONS"
.
.TP
\fBdestroy\fR \- Delete a certificate\.
\fBSYNOPSIS\fR
.
.IP
puppet certificate destroy [\-\-terminus TERMINUS] [\-\-extra HASH] \fI\-\-ca\-location LOCATION\fR \fIhost\fR
.
.IP
\fBDESCRIPTION\fR
.
.IP
Deletes a certificate\. This action currently only works on the local CA\.
.
.IP
\fBRETURNS\fR
.
.IP
Nothing\.
.
.TP
\fBfind\fR \- Retrieve a certificate\.
\fBSYNOPSIS\fR
.
.IP
puppet certificate find [\-\-terminus TERMINUS] [\-\-extra HASH] \fI\-\-ca\-location LOCATION\fR \fIhost\fR
.
.IP
\fBDESCRIPTION\fR
.
.IP
Retrieve a certificate\.
.
.IP
\fBRETURNS\fR
.
.IP
An x509 SSL certificate\.
.
.IP
Note that this action has a side effect of caching a copy of the certificate in Puppet\'s \fBssldir\fR\.
.
.TP
\fBgenerate\fR \- Generate a new certificate signing request\.
\fBSYNOPSIS\fR
.
.IP
puppet certificate generate [\-\-terminus TERMINUS] [\-\-extra HASH] \fI\-\-ca\-location LOCATION\fR [\-\-dns\-alt\-names NAMES] \fIhost\fR
.
.IP
\fBDESCRIPTION\fR
.
.IP
Generates and submits a certificate signing request (CSR) for the specified host\. This CSR will then have to be signed by a user with the proper authorization on the certificate authority\.
.
.IP
Puppet agent usually handles CSR submission automatically\. This action is primarily useful for requesting certificates for individual users and external applications\.
.
.IP
\fBOPTIONS\fR \fI\-\-dns\-alt\-names NAMES\fR \- The comma\-separated list of alternative DNS names to use for the local host\.
.
.IP
When the node generates a CSR for itself, these are added to the request as the desired \fBsubjectAltName\fR in the certificate: additional DNS labels that the certificate is also valid answering as\.
.
.IP
This is generally required if you use a non\-hostname \fBcertname\fR, or if you want to use \fBpuppet kick\fR or \fBpuppet resource \-H\fR and the primary certname does not match the DNS name you use to communicate with the host\.
.
.IP
This is unnecessary for agents, unless you intend to use them as a server for \fBpuppet kick\fR or remote \fBpuppet resource\fR management\.
.
.IP
It is rarely necessary for servers; it is usually helpful only if you need to have a pool of multiple load balanced masters, or for the same master to respond on two physically separate networks under different names\.
.
.IP
\fBRETURNS\fR
.
.IP
Nothing\.
.
.TP
\fBinfo\fR \- Print the default terminus class for this face\.
\fBSYNOPSIS\fR
.
.IP
puppet certificate info [\-\-terminus TERMINUS] [\-\-extra HASH] \fI\-\-ca\-location LOCATION\fR
.
.IP
\fBDESCRIPTION\fR
.
.IP
Prints the default terminus class for this subcommand\. Note that different run modes may have different default termini; when in doubt, specify the run mode with the \'\-\-run_mode\' option\.
.
.TP
\fBlist\fR \- List all certificate signing requests\.
\fBSYNOPSIS\fR
.
.IP
puppet certificate list [\-\-terminus TERMINUS] [\-\-extra HASH] \fI\-\-ca\-location LOCATION\fR
.
.IP
\fBDESCRIPTION\fR
.
.IP
List all certificate signing requests\.
.
.IP
\fBRETURNS\fR
.
.IP
An array of #inspect output from CSR objects\. This output is currently messy, but does contain the names of nodes requesting certificates\. This action returns #inspect strings even when used from the Ruby API\.
.
.TP
\fBsign\fR \- Sign a certificate signing request for HOST\.
\fBSYNOPSIS\fR
.
.IP
puppet certificate sign [\-\-terminus TERMINUS] [\-\-extra HASH] \fI\-\-ca\-location LOCATION\fR [\-\-[no\-]allow\-dns\-alt\-names] \fIhost\fR
.
.IP
\fBDESCRIPTION\fR
.
.IP
Sign a certificate signing request for HOST\.

.IP
\fBOPTIONS\fR \fI\-\-[no\-]allow\-dns\-alt\-names\fR \- Whether or not to accept DNS alt names in the certificate request
.
.IP
\fBRETURNS\fR
.
.IP
A string that appears to be (but isn\'t) an x509 certificate\.
.
.SH "EXAMPLES"

.
.P
$ puppet certificate generate somenode\.puppetlabs\.lan \-\-ca\-location remote
