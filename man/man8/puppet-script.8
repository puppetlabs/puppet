.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This is a standalone puppet script runner tool; use it to run puppet code without compiling a catalog\.
.
.P
When provided with a modulepath, via command line or config file, puppet script can load functions, types, tasks and plans from modules\.
.
.SH "OPTIONS"
Note that any setting that\'s valid in the configuration file is also a valid long argument\. For example, \'environment\' is a valid setting, so you can specify \'\-\-environment mytest\' as an argument\.
