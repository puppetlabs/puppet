.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
This is a stand\-alone filebucket client for sending files to a local or
central filebucket.
.SH USAGE
.sp
This client can operate in three modes, with only one mode per call:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B backup:  Send one or more files to the specified file bucket. Each sent
.
file is printed with its resulting md5 sum.
.TP
.B get:     Return the text associated with an md5 sum. The text is printed
.
to stdout, and only one file can be retrieved at a time.
.TP
.B restore: Given a file path and an md5 sum, store the content associated
.
with the sum into the specified file path. You can specify an
entirely new path to this argument; you are not restricted to
restoring the content to its original location.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Note that +filebucket+ defaults to using a network\-based filebucket
available on the server named +puppet+. To use this, you\(aqll have to be
running as a user with valid Puppet certificates. Alternatively, you can
use your local file bucket by specifying +\-\-local+.

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
Note that any configuration parameter that\(aqs valid in the configuration
file is also a valid long argument. For example, \(aqssldir\(aq is a valid
configuration parameter, so you can specify \(aq\-\-ssldir <directory>\(aq as an
argument.
.sp
See the configuration file documentation at
\fI\%http://reductivelabs.com/trac/puppet/wiki/ConfigurationReference\fP for the
full list of acceptable parameters. A commented list of all
configuration options can also be generated by running puppet with
\(aq\-\-genconfig\(aq.
