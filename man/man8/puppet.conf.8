.SH Specifying Configuration Parameters

.SS On The Command\-Line
Every Puppet executable (with the exception of 
.\" visit_literal
puppetdoc
.\" depart_literal
) accepts all of
the parameters below, but not all of the arguments make sense for every executable.
Each parameter has a section listed with it in parentheses; often, that section
will map to an executable (e.g., 
.\" visit_literal
puppetd
.\" depart_literal
), in which case it probably only
makes sense for that one executable.  If 
.\" visit_literal
main
.\" depart_literal
 is listed as the section,
it is most likely an option that is valid for everyone.

I have tried to be as thorough as possible in the descriptions of the
arguments, so it should be obvious whether an argument is appropriate or not.

These parameters can be supplied to the executables either as command\-line
options or in the configuration file.  For instance, the command\-line
invocation below would set the configuration directory to 
.\" visit_literal
/private/puppet
.\" depart_literal
:


.nf
$ puppetd \-\-confdir=/private/puppet
.fi
Note that boolean options are turned on and off with a slightly different
syntax on the command line:


.nf
$ puppetd \-\-storeconfigs

$ puppetd \-\-no\-storeconfigs
.fi
The invocations above will enable and disable, respectively, the storage of
the client configuration.


.SS Configuration Files
As mentioned above, the configuration parameters can also be stored in a
configuration file, located in the configuration directory.  As root, the
default configuration directory is 
.\" visit_literal
/etc/puppet
.\" depart_literal
, and as a regular user, the
default configuration directory is 
.\" visit_literal
~user/.puppet
.\" depart_literal
.  As of 0.23.0, all
executables look for 
.\" visit_literal
puppet.conf
.\" depart_literal
 in their configuration directory
(although they previously looked for separate files).  For example,

.\" visit_literal
puppet.conf
.\" depart_literal
 is located at 
.\" visit_literal
/etc/puppet/puppet.conf
.\" depart_literal
 as root and

.\" visit_literal
~user/.puppet/puppet.conf
.\" depart_literal
 as a regular user by default.

All executables will set any parameters set within the 
.\" visit_literal
main
.\" depart_literal
 section,
while each executable will also look for a section named for the executable
and load those parameters.  For example, 
.\" visit_literal
puppetd
.\" depart_literal
 will look for a
section named 
.\" visit_literal
puppetd
.\" depart_literal
, and 
.\" visit_literal
puppetmasterd
.\" depart_literal
 looks for a section
named 
.\" visit_literal
puppetmasterd
.\" depart_literal
.  This allows you to use a single configuration file
to customize the settings for all of your executables.


.SS File Format
The file follows INI\-style formatting.  Here is an example of a very simple

.\" visit_literal
puppet.conf
.\" depart_literal
 file:


.nf
[main]
    confdir = /private/puppet
    storeconfigs = true
.fi
Note that boolean parameters must be explicitly specified as 
.I true
 or

.I false
 as seen above.

If you need to change file parameters (e.g., reset the mode or owner), do
so within curly braces on the same line:


.nf
[main]
    myfile = /tmp/whatever {owner = root, mode = 644}
.fi
If you\'re starting out with a fresh configuration, you may wish to let
the executable generate a template configuration file for you by invoking
the executable in question with the 
.I \-\-genconfig
 command.  The executable
will print a template configuration to standard output, which can be
redirected to a file like so:


.nf
$ puppetd \-\-genconfig > /etc/puppet/puppet.conf
.fi
Note that this invocation will replace the contents of any pre\-existing

.I puppet.conf
 file, so make a backup of your present config if it contains
valuable information.

All parameters will be under a single section heading matching the name of
the process used to generate the configuraiton (\'puppetd\', in this case).

Like the 
.I \-\-genconfig
 argument, the executables also accept a 
.I \-\-genmanifest

argument, which will generate a manifest that can be used to manage all of
Puppet\'s directories and files and prints it to standard output.  This can
likewise be redirected to a file:


.nf
$ puppetd \-\-genmanifest > /etc/puppet/manifests/site.pp
.fi
Puppet can also create user and group accounts for itself (one 
.I puppet
 group
and one 
.I puppet
 user) if it is invoked as 
.I root
 with the 
.I \-\-mkusers
 argument:


.nf
$ puppetd \-\-mkusers
.fi

.SH Signals
The 
.\" visit_literal
puppetd
.\" depart_literal
 and 
.\" visit_literal
puppetmasterd
.\" depart_literal
 executables catch some signals for special
handling.  Both daemons catch (
.\" visit_literal
SIGHUP
.\" depart_literal
), which forces the server to restart
tself.  Predictably, interrupt and terminate (
.\" visit_literal
SIGINT
.\" depart_literal
 and 
.\" visit_literal
SIGHUP
.\" depart_literal
) will shut
down the server, whether it be an instance of 
.\" visit_literal
puppetd
.\" depart_literal
 or 
.\" visit_literal
puppetmasterd
.\" depart_literal
.

Sending the 
.\" visit_literal
SIGUSR1
.\" depart_literal
 signal to an instance of 
.\" visit_literal
puppetd
.\" depart_literal
 will cause it to
immediately begin a new configuration transaction with the server.  This
signal has no effect on 
.\" visit_literal
puppetmasterd
.\" depart_literal
.


.SH Configuration Parameter Reference
Below is a list of all documented parameters.  Not all of them are valid with all
Puppet executables, but the executables will ignore any inappropriate values.


.SS authconfig

.\" depart_literal
.

.\" visit_literal
false
.\" depart_literal
, which produces no color.


.TP 2
\(bu
Default: ansi


.SS confdir
The main Puppet configuration directory.  The default for this parameter is calculated based on the user.  If the process is runnig as root or the user that 
.\" visit_literal

.TP 2
\(bu
Default: memorysize,memoryfree,swapsize,swapfree


.SS environment
The environment Puppet is running in.  For clients (e.g., 
.\" visit_literal
puppetd
.\" depart_literal
) this determines the environment itself, which is used to find modules and much more.  For servers (i.e., 
.\" visit_literal
puppetmasterd
.\" depart_literal
) this provides the default environment for nodes we know nothing about.


.TP 2
\(bu
Default: production


.SS environments

, where 
.\" visit_literal
classes
.\" depart_literal
 is an array and 
.\" visit_literal
parameters

.\" visit_literal
ldapnodes
.\" depart_literal
 is enabled.

The search string used to find an LDAP node.


.TP 2
\(bu
Default: (&(objectclass=puppetClient)(cn=%s))

.TP 2
\(bu
Default: $vardir/lib


.SS listen

.TP 2
\(bu
Default: webrick


.SS show_diff
Whether to print a contextual diff when files are being replaced.  The diff is printed on stdout, so this option is meaningless unless you are running Puppet interactively. This feature currently requires the

.TP 2
\(bu
Default: $vardir/state


.SS statefile
Where puppetd and puppetmasterd store state associated with the running configuration.  In the case of puppetmasterd, this file reflects the state discovered through interacting with clients.


.TP 2
\(bu

\(bu
Default: false


.SS typecheck
Whether to validate types during parsing.


.TP 2
\(bu
Default: true


.SS usecacheonfailure

.TP 2
\(bu
Default: true


.SS user
