.TH "PUPPET\-NODE" "8" "November 2024" "Puppet, Inc." "Puppet manual"
.
.SH "NAME"
\fBpuppet\-node\fR \- View and manage node definitions\.
.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
puppet node \fIaction\fR [\-\-terminus _TERMINUS]
.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This subcommand interacts with node objects, which are used by Puppet to build a catalog\. A node object consists of the node\'s facts, environment, node parameters (exposed in the parser as top\-scope variables), and classes\.
.
.SH "OPTIONS"
Note that any setting that\'s valid in the configuration file is also a valid long argument, although it may or may not be relevant to the present action\. For example, \fBserver\fR and \fBrun_mode\fR are valid settings, so you can specify \fB\-\-server <servername>\fR, or \fB\-\-run_mode <runmode>\fR as an argument\.
.
.P
See the configuration file documentation at \fIhttps://puppet\.com/docs/puppet/latest/configuration\.html\fR for the full list of acceptable parameters\. A commented list of all configuration options can also be generated by running puppet with \fB\-\-genconfig\fR\.
.
.TP
\-\-render\-as FORMAT
The format in which to render output\. The most common formats are \fBjson\fR, \fBs\fR (string), \fByaml\fR, and \fBconsole\fR, but other options such as \fBdot\fR are sometimes available\.
.
.TP
\-\-verbose
Whether to log verbosely\.
.
.TP
\-\-debug
Whether to log debug information\.
.
.TP
\-\-extra HASH
A terminus can take additional arguments to refine the operation, which are passed as an arbitrary hash to the back\-end\. Anything passed as the extra value is just send direct to the back\-end\.
.
.TP
\-\-terminus _TERMINUS
Indirector faces expose indirected subsystems of Puppet\. These subsystems are each able to retrieve and alter a specific type of data (with the familiar actions of \fBfind\fR, \fBsearch\fR, \fBsave\fR, and \fBdestroy\fR) from an arbitrary number of pluggable backends\. In Puppet parlance, these backends are called terminuses\.
.
.IP
Almost all indirected subsystems have a \fBrest\fR terminus that interacts with the puppet master\'s data\. Most of them have additional terminuses for various local data models, which are in turn used by the indirected subsystem on the puppet master whenever it receives a remote request\.
.
.IP
The terminus for an action is often determined by context, but occasionally needs to be set explicitly\. See the "Notes" section of this face\'s manpage for more details\.
.
.SH "ACTIONS"
.
.TP
\fBclean\fR \- Clean up signed certs, cached facts, node objects, and reports for a node stored by the puppetmaster
\fBSYNOPSIS\fR
.
.IP
puppet node clean [\-\-terminus _TERMINUS] \fIhost1\fR [\fIhost2\fR \.\.\.]
.
.IP
\fBDESCRIPTION\fR
.
.IP
Cleans up the following information a puppet master knows about a node:
.
.IP
\fISigned certificates\fR \- ($vardir/ssl/ca/signed/node\.domain\.pem)
.
.IP
\fICached facts\fR \- ($vardir/yaml/facts/node\.domain\.yaml)
.
.IP
\fICached node objects\fR \- ($vardir/yaml/node/node\.domain\.yaml)
.
.IP
\fIReports\fR \- ($vardir/reports/node\.domain)
.
.IP
NOTE: this action now cleans up certs via Puppet Server\'s CA API\. A running server is required for certs to be cleaned\.
.
.TP
\fBfind\fR \- Retrieve a node object\.
\fBSYNOPSIS\fR
.
.IP
puppet node find [\-\-terminus _TERMINUS] \fIhost\fR
.
.IP
\fBDESCRIPTION\fR
.
.IP
Retrieve a node object\.
.
.IP
\fBRETURNS\fR
.
.IP
A hash containing the node\'s \fBclasses\fR, \fBenvironment\fR, \fBexpiration\fR, \fBname\fR, \fBparameters\fR (its facts, combined with any ENC\-set parameters), and \fBtime\fR\. When used from the Ruby API: a Puppet::Node object\.
.
.IP
RENDERING ISSUES: Rendering as string and json are currently broken; node objects can only be rendered as yaml\.
.
.TP
\fBinfo\fR \- Print the default terminus class for this face\.
\fBSYNOPSIS\fR
.
.IP
puppet node info [\-\-terminus _TERMINUS]
.
.IP
\fBDESCRIPTION\fR
.
.IP
Prints the default terminus class for this subcommand\. Note that different run modes may have different default termini; when in doubt, specify the run mode with the \'\-\-run_mode\' option\.
.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
\fBfind\fR
.
.P
Retrieve an "empty" (no classes, no ENC\-imposed parameters, and an environment of "production") node:
.
.P
$ puppet node find somenode\.puppetlabs\.lan \-\-terminus plain \-\-render\-as yaml
.
.P
Retrieve a node using the Puppet Server\'s configured ENC:
.
.P
$ puppet node find somenode\.puppetlabs\.lan \-\-terminus exec \-\-run_mode server \-\-render\-as yaml
.
.P
Retrieve the same node from the Puppet Server:
.
.P
$ puppet node find somenode\.puppetlabs\.lan \-\-terminus rest \-\-render\-as yaml
.
.SH "NOTES"
