.
.SH "NAME"
\fBpuppet\-facts\fR \- Retrieve and store facts\.
.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
puppet facts \fIaction\fR [\-\-terminus TERMINUS]
.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This subcommand manages facts, which are collections of normalized system information used by Puppet\. It can read facts directly from the local system (with the default \fBfacter\fR terminus), look up facts reported by other systems, and submit facts to the puppet master\.
.
.P
When used with the \fBrest\fR terminus, this subcommand is essentially a front\-end to the inventory service REST API\. See the inventory service documentation at \fIhttp://docs\.puppetlabs\.com/guides/inventory_service\.html\fR for more detail\.
.
.SH "OPTIONS"
Note that any configuration parameter that\'s valid in the configuration file is also a valid long argument, although it may or may not be relevant to the present action\. For example, \fBserver\fR is a valid configuration parameter, so you can specify \fB\-\-server <servername>\fR as an argument\.
.
.P
See the configuration file documentation at \fIhttp://docs\.puppetlabs\.com/references/stable/configuration\.html\fR for the full list of acceptable parameters\. A commented list of all configuration options can also be generated by running puppet with \fB\-\-genconfig\fR\.
.
.TP
\-\-mode MODE
The run mode to use for the current action\. Valid modes are \fBuser\fR, \fBagent\fR, and \fBmaster\fR\.
.
.TP
\-\-render\-as FORMAT
The format in which to render output\. The most common formats are \fBjson\fR, \fBs\fR (string), \fByaml\fR, and \fBconsole\fR, but other options such as \fBdot\fR are sometimes available\.
.
.TP
\-\-verbose
Whether to log verbosely\.
.
.TP
\-\-debug
Whether to log debug information\.
.
.TP
\-\-terminus TERMINUS
Indirector faces expose indirected subsystems of Puppet\. These subsystems are each able to retrieve and alter a specific type of data (with the familiar actions of \fBfind\fR, \fBsearch\fR, \fBsave\fR, and \fBdestroy\fR) from an arbitrary number of pluggable backends\. In Puppet parlance, these backends are called terminuses\.
.
.IP
Almost all indirected subsystems have a \fBrest\fR terminus that interacts with the puppet master\'s data\. Most of them have additional terminuses for various local data models, which are in turn used by the indirected subsystem on the puppet master whenever it receives a remote request\.
.
.IP
The terminus for an action is often determined by context, but occasionally needs to be set explicitly\. See the "Notes" section of this face\'s manpage for more details\.

puppet facts destroy [\-\-terminus TERMINUS] \fIkey\fR
.
.IP

.
.IP
Invalid for this subcommand\.
.
.TP
\fBfind\fR \- Retrieve a node\'s facts\.
\fBSYNOPSIS\fR
.
.IP
puppet facts find [\-\-terminus TERMINUS] \fInode_certname\fR
.
.IP
\fBDESCRIPTION\fR
.
.IP
Retrieve a node\'s facts\.
.
.IP
\fBRETURNS\fR
.
.IP
A hash containing some metadata and (under the "values" key) the set of facts for the requested node\. When used from the Ruby API: A Puppet::Node::Facts object\.
.
.IP
RENDERING ISSUES: Facts cannot currently be rendered as a string; use yaml or json\.
.
.IP
\fBNOTES\fR
.
.IP
When using the \fBfacter\fR terminus, the host argument is ignored\.
.
.TP
\fBinfo\fR \- Print the default terminus class for this face\.
\fBSYNOPSIS\fR
.
.IP
puppet facts info [\-\-terminus TERMINUS]
.
.IP
\fBDESCRIPTION\fR
.
.IP
Prints the default terminus class for this subcommand\. Note that different run modes may have different default termini; when in doubt, specify the run mode with the \'\-\-mode\' option\.
.
.TP
\fBsave\fR \- API only: create or overwrite an object\.
\fBSYNOPSIS\fR
.
.IP
puppet facts save [\-\-terminus TERMINUS]
.
.IP
\fBDESCRIPTION\fR
.
.IP
API only: create or overwrite an object\. As the Faces framework does not currently accept data from STDIN, save actions cannot currently be invoked from the command line\.
.
.TP
\fBsearch\fR \- Invalid for this subcommand\.
\fBSYNOPSIS\fR
.
.IP
puppet facts search [\-\-terminus TERMINUS] \fIquery\fR
.

.
.IP
Invalid for this subcommand\.

\fBupload\fR \- Upload local facts to the puppet master\.
\fBSYNOPSIS\fR
.
.IP
puppet facts upload [\-\-terminus TERMINUS]
.
.IP
\fBDESCRIPTION\fR
.
.IP
Reads facts from the local system using the \fBfacter\fR terminus, then saves the returned facts using the rest terminus\.
.
.IP
\fBRETURNS\fR
.
.IP
Nothing\.
.
.IP
\fBNOTES\fR
.
.IP
This action requires that the puppet master\'s \fBauth\.conf\fR file allow save access to the \fBfacts\fR REST terminus\. Puppet agent does not use this facility, and it is turned off by default\. See \fIhttp://docs\.puppetlabs\.com/guides/rest_auth_conf\.html\fR for more details\.
.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
\fBfind\fR
.
.P
Get facts from the local system:
.
.P
$ puppet facts find x
.
.P
Ask the puppet master for facts for an arbitrary node:
.
.P
$ puppet facts find somenode\.puppetlabs\.lan \-\-terminus rest
.
.P
Query a DB\-backed inventory directly (bypassing the REST API):
.
.P
$ puppet facts find somenode\.puppetlabs\.lan \-\-terminus inventory_active_record \-\-mode master
.
.P
\fBupload\fR
.
.P
Upload facts:
.
.P
$ puppet facts upload
.
