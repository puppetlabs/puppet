.TH "PUPPET\-CATALOG" "8" "November 2024" "Puppet, Inc." "Puppet manual"
.
.SH "NAME"
\fBpuppet\-catalog\fR \- Compile, save, view, and convert catalogs\.
.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
puppet catalog \fIaction\fR [\-\-terminus _TERMINUS]
.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This subcommand deals with catalogs, which are compiled per\-node artifacts generated from a set of Puppet manifests\. By default, it interacts with the compiling subsystem and compiles a catalog using the default manifest and \fBcertname\fR, but you can change the source of the catalog with the \fB\-\-terminus\fR option\. You can also choose to print any catalog in \'dot\' format (for easy graph viewing with OmniGraffle or Graphviz) with \'\-\-render\-as dot\'\.
.
.SH "OPTIONS"
Note that any setting that\'s valid in the configuration file is also a valid long argument, although it may or may not be relevant to the present action\. For example, \fBserver\fR and \fBrun_mode\fR are valid settings, so you can specify \fB\-\-server <servername>\fR, or \fB\-\-run_mode <runmode>\fR as an argument\.
.
.P
See the configuration file documentation at \fIhttps://puppet\.com/docs/puppet/latest/configuration\.html\fR for the full list of acceptable parameters\. A commented list of all configuration options can also be generated by running puppet with \fB\-\-genconfig\fR\.
.
.TP
\-\-render\-as FORMAT
The format in which to render output\. The most common formats are \fBjson\fR, \fBs\fR (string), \fByaml\fR, and \fBconsole\fR, but other options such as \fBdot\fR are sometimes available\.
.
.TP
\-\-verbose
Whether to log verbosely\.
.
.TP
\-\-debug
Whether to log debug information\.
.
.TP
\-\-extra HASH
A terminus can take additional arguments to refine the operation, which are passed as an arbitrary hash to the back\-end\. Anything passed as the extra value is just send direct to the back\-end\.
.
.TP
\-\-terminus _TERMINUS
Indirector faces expose indirected subsystems of Puppet\. These subsystems are each able to retrieve and alter a specific type of data (with the familiar actions of \fBfind\fR, \fBsearch\fR, \fBsave\fR, and \fBdestroy\fR) from an arbitrary number of pluggable backends\. In Puppet parlance, these backends are called terminuses\.
.
.IP
Almost all indirected subsystems have a \fBrest\fR terminus that interacts with the puppet master\'s data\. Most of them have additional terminuses for various local data models, which are in turn used by the indirected subsystem on the puppet master whenever it receives a remote request\.
.
.IP
The terminus for an action is often determined by context, but occasionally needs to be set explicitly\. See the "Notes" section of this face\'s manpage for more details\.
.
.SH "ACTIONS"
.
.TP
\fBapply\fR \- Find and apply a catalog\.
\fBSYNOPSIS\fR
.
.IP
puppet catalog apply [\-\-terminus _TERMINUS]
.
.IP
\fBDESCRIPTION\fR
.
.IP
Finds and applies a catalog\. This action takes no arguments, but the source of the catalog can be managed with the \fB\-\-terminus\fR option\.
.
.IP
\fBRETURNS\fR
.
.IP
Nothing\. When used from the Ruby API, returns a Puppet::Transaction::Report object\.
.
.TP
\fBcompile\fR \- Compile a catalog\.
\fBSYNOPSIS\fR
.
.IP
puppet catalog compile [\-\-terminus _TERMINUS]
.
.IP
\fBDESCRIPTION\fR
.
.IP
Compiles a catalog locally for a node, requiring access to modules, node classifier, etc\.
.
.IP
\fBRETURNS\fR
.
.IP
A serialized catalog\.
.
.TP
\fBdownload\fR \- Download this node\'s catalog from the puppet master server\.
\fBSYNOPSIS\fR
.
.IP
puppet catalog download [\-\-terminus _TERMINUS]
.
.IP
\fBDESCRIPTION\fR
.
.IP
Retrieves a catalog from the puppet master and saves it to the local yaml cache\. This action always contacts the puppet master and will ignore alternate termini\.
.
.IP
The saved catalog can be used in any subsequent catalog action by specifying \'\-\-terminus yaml\' for that action\.
.
.IP
\fBRETURNS\fR
.
.IP
Nothing\.
.
.IP
\fBNOTES\fR
.
.IP
When used from the Ruby API, this action has a side effect of leaving Puppet::Resource::Catalog\.indirection\.terminus_class set to yaml\. The terminus must be explicitly re\-set for subsequent catalog actions\.
.
.TP
\fBfind\fR \- Retrieve the catalog for the node from which the comamand is run\.
\fBSYNOPSIS\fR
.
.IP
puppet catalog find [\-\-terminus _TERMINUS] [\-\-facts_for_catalog] \fIcertname\fR, \fIfacts\fR
.
.IP
\fBDESCRIPTION\fR
.
.IP
Retrieve the catalog for the node from which the comamand is run\.
.
.IP
\fBOPTIONS\fR \fI\-\-facts_for_catalog\fR \- Not yet implemented for the CLI; facts will be collected internally\.
.
.IP
\fBRETURNS\fR
.
.IP
A serialized catalog\. When used from the Ruby API, returns a Puppet::Resource::Catalog object\.
.
.TP
\fBinfo\fR \- Print the default terminus class for this face\.
\fBSYNOPSIS\fR
.
.IP
puppet catalog info [\-\-terminus _TERMINUS]
.
.IP
\fBDESCRIPTION\fR
.
.IP
Prints the default terminus class for this subcommand\. Note that different run modes may have different default termini; when in doubt, specify the run mode with the \'\-\-run_mode\' option\.
.
.TP
\fBsave\fR \- API only: create or overwrite an object\.
\fBSYNOPSIS\fR
.
.IP
puppet catalog save [\-\-terminus _TERMINUS] \fIkey\fR
.
.IP
\fBDESCRIPTION\fR
.
.IP
API only: create or overwrite an object\. As the Faces framework does not currently accept data from STDIN, save actions cannot currently be invoked from the command line\.
.
.TP
\fBselect\fR \- Retrieve a catalog and filter it for resources of a given type\.
\fBSYNOPSIS\fR
.
.IP
puppet catalog select [\-\-terminus _TERMINUS] \fIhost\fR \fIresource_type\fR
.
.IP
\fBDESCRIPTION\fR
.
.IP
Retrieves a catalog for the specified host, then searches it for all resources of the requested type\.
.
.IP
\fBRETURNS\fR
.
.IP
A list of resource references ("Type[title]")\. When used from the API, returns an array of Puppet::Resource objects excised from a catalog\.
.
.IP
\fBNOTES\fR
.
.IP
By default, this action will retrieve a catalog from Puppet\'s compiler subsystem; you must call the action with \fB\-\-terminus rest\fR if you wish to retrieve a catalog from the puppet master\.
.
.IP
FORMATTING ISSUES: This action cannot currently render useful yaml; instead, it returns an entire catalog\. Use json instead\.
.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
\fBapply\fR

.
.P
