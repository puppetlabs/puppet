.SH DESCRIPTION
This is the puppet central daemon.


.SH OPTIONS
Note that any configuration parameter that\'s valid in the configuration
file is also a valid long argument. For example, \'ssldir\' is a valid
configuration parameter, so you can specify \'\-\-ssldir <directory>\' as an
argument.

See the configuration file documentation at
http://reductivelabs.com/projects/puppet/reference/configref.html for
the full list of acceptable parameters. A commented list of all
configuration options can also be generated by running puppetmasterdd
with \'\-\-genconfig\'.

daemonize:    Send the process into the background. This is the default.

no\-daemonize: Do not send the process into the background.

debug:        Enable full debugging.

help:         Print this help message.


.TP
.B logdest:      Where to send messages. Choose between syslog, the
console, and a log file. Defaults to sending messages to
syslog, or the console if debugging or verbosity is
enabled.

nobucket:     Do not function as a file bucket.


.TP
.B nonodes:      Do not use individual node designations; each node will
receive the result of evaluating the entire configuration.

noreports:    Do not start the reports server.

verbose:      Enable verbosity.

version:      Print the puppet version number and exit.
