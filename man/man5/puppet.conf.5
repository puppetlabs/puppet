.SH "Configuration settings"
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Each of these settings can be specified in \fBpuppet\.conf\fR or on the command line\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Puppet Enterprise (PE) and open source Puppet share the configuration settings documented here\. However, PE defaults differ from open source defaults for some settings, such as \fBnode_terminus\fR, \fBstoreconfigs\fR, \fBalways_retry_plugins\fR, \fBdisable18n\fR, \fBenvironment_timeout\fR (when Code Manager is enabled), and the Puppet Server JRuby \fBmax\-active\-instances\fR setting\. To verify PE configuration defaults, check the \fBpuppet\.conf\fR or \fBpe\-puppet\-server\.conf\fR file after installation\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
When using boolean settings on the command line, use \fB\-\-setting\fR and \fB\-\-no\-setting\fR instead of \fB\-\-setting (true|false)\fR\. (Using \fB\-\-setting false\fR results in "Error: Could not parse application options: needless argument"\.)
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Settings can be interpolated as \fB$variables\fR in other settings; \fB$environment\fR is special, in that puppet master will interpolate each agent node\'s environment instead of its own\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Multiple values should be specified as comma\-separated lists; multiple directories should be separated with the system path separator (usually a colon)\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Settings that represent time intervals should be specified in duration format: an integer immediately followed by one of the units \'y\' (years of 365 days), \'d\' (days), \'h\' (hours), \'m\' (minutes), or \'s\' (seconds)\. The unit cannot be combined with other units, and defaults to seconds when omitted\. Examples are \'3600\' which is equivalent to \'1h\' (one hour), and \'1825d\' which is equivalent to \'5y\' (5 years)\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
If you use the \fBsplay\fR setting, note that the period that it waits changes each time the Puppet agent is restarted\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Settings that take a single file or directory can optionally set the owner, group, and mode for their value: \fBrundir = $vardir/run { owner = puppet, group = puppet, mode = 644 }\fR
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The Puppet executables ignores any setting that isn\'t relevant to their function\.

.SS "agent_catalog_run_lockfile"
A lock file to indicate that a puppet agent catalog run is currently in progress\. The file contains the pid of the process that holds the lock on the catalog run\.

.
.SS "allow_duplicate_certs"
Whether to allow a new certificate request to overwrite an existing certificate request\. If true, then the old certificate must be cleaned using \fBpuppetserver ca clean\fR, and the new request signed using \fBpuppetserver ca sign\fR\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fIDefault\fR: \fBfalse\fR
.
.IP "" 0
.
.SS "allow_pson_serialization"
Whether to allow PSON serialization\. When unable to serialize to JSON or other formats, Puppet falls back to PSON\. This option affects the configuration management service responses of Puppet Server and the process by which the agent saves its cached catalog\. With a default value of \fBfalse\fR, this option is useful in preventing the loss of data because rich data cannot be serialized via PSON\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fIDefault\fR: \fBfalse\fR
.
.IP "" 0
.
.SS "always_retry_plugins"
Affects how we cache attempts to load Puppet resource types and features\. If true, then calls to \fBPuppet\.type\.<type>?\fR \fBPuppet\.feature\.<feature>?\fR will always attempt to load the type or feature (which can be an expensive operation) unless it has already been loaded successfully\. This makes it possible for a single agent run to, e\.g\., install a package that provides the underlying capabilities for a type or feature, and then later load that type or feature during the same run (even if the type or feature had been tested earlier and had not been available)\.
.
.P
If this setting is set to false, then types and features will only be checked once, and if they are not available, the negative result is cached and returned for all subsequent attempts to load the type or feature\. This behavior is almost always appropriate for the server, and can result in a significant performance improvement for types and features that are checked frequently\.

.
.SS "autosign"
Whether (and how) to autosign certificate requests\. This setting is only relevant on a Puppet Server acting as a certificate authority (CA)\.
.
.P
Valid values are true (autosigns all certificate requests; not recommended), false (disables autosigning certificates), or the absolute path to a file\.
.
.P
The file specified in this setting may be either a \fBconfiguration file\fR or a \fBcustom policy executable\.\fR Puppet will automatically determine what it is: If the Puppet user (see the \fBuser\fR setting) can execute the file, it will be treated as a policy executable; otherwise, it will be treated as a config file\.
.
.P
If a custom policy executable is configured, the CA Puppet Server will run it every time it receives a CSR\. The executable will be passed the subject CN of the request \fIas a command line argument,\fR and the contents of the CSR in PEM format \fIon stdin\.\fR It should exit with a status of 0 if the cert should be autosigned and non\-zero if the cert should not be autosigned\.
.
.P
If a certificate request is not autosigned, it will persist for review\. An admin user can use the \fBpuppetserver ca sign\fR command to manually sign it, or can delete the request\.
.

The search path for \fBglobal\fR modules\. Should be specified as a list of directories separated by the system path separator character\. (The POSIX path separator is \':\', and the Windows path separator is \';\'\.)
.
.P
These are the modules that will be used by \fIall\fR environments\. Note that the \fBmodules\fR directory of the active environment will have priority over any global directories\. For more info, see \fIhttps://puppet\.com/docs/puppet/latest/environments_about\.html\fR

.SS "ca_refresh_interval"
How often the Puppet agent refreshes its local CA certificates\. By default, CA certificates are refreshed every 24 hours\. If a different interval is specified, the agent refreshes its CA certificates during the next agent run if the elapsed time since the certificates were last refreshed exceeds the specified duration\.
.
.P
In general, the interval should be greater than the \fBruninterval\fR value\. Setting the \fBca_refresh_interval\fR value to 0 or an equal or lesser value than \fBruninterval\fR causes the CA certificates to be refreshed on every run\.
.
.P
If the agent downloads new CA certs, the agent uses those for subsequent network requests\. If the refresh request fails or if the CA certs are unchanged on the server, then the agent run will continue using the local CA certs it already has\. This setting can be a time interval in seconds (30 or 30s), minutes (30m), hours (6h), days (2d), or years (5y)\.

.
.SS "certificate_revocation"
Whether certificate revocation checking should be enabled, and what level of checking should be performed\.
.
.P
When certificate revocation is enabled, Puppet expects the contents of its CRL to be one or more PEM\-encoded CRLs concatenated together\. When using a cert bundle, CRLs for all CAs in the chain of trust must be included in the crl file\. The chain should be ordered from least to most authoritative, with the first CRL listed being for the root of the chain and the last being for the leaf CA\.
.
.P
When certificate_revocation is set to \'true\' or \'chain\', Puppet ensures that each CA in the chain of trust has not been revoked by its issuing CA\.
.
.P
When certificate_revocation is set to \'leaf\', Puppet verifies certs against the issuing CA\'s revocation list, but it does not verify the revocation status of the issuing CA or any CA above it within the chain of trust\.
.
.P
When certificate_revocation is set to \'false\', Puppet disables all certificate revocation checking and does not attempt to download the CRL\.

.
.SS "certname"
The name to use when handling certificates\. When a node requests a certificate from the CA Puppet Server, it uses the value of the \fBcertname\fR setting as its requested Subject CN\.
.
.P
This is the name used when managing a node\'s permissions in Puppet Server\'s auth\.conf \fIhttps://puppet\.com/docs/puppetserver/latest/config_file_auth\.html\fR\. In most cases, it is also used as the node\'s name when matching node definitions \fIhttps://puppet\.com/docs/puppet/latest/lang_node_definitions\.html\fR and requesting data from an ENC\. (This can be changed with the \fBnode_name_value\fR and \fBnode_name_fact\fR settings, although you should only do so if you have a compelling reason\.)
.
.P
A node\'s certname is available in Puppet manifests as \fB$trusted[\'certname\']\fR\. (See Facts and Built\-In Variables \fIhttps://puppet\.com/docs/puppet/latest/lang_facts_and_builtin_vars\.html\fR for more details\.)

How to determine the configuration version\. By default, it will be the time that the configuration is parsed, but you can provide a shell script to override how the version is determined\. The output of this script will be added to every log message in the reports, allowing you to correlate changes on your hosts to the source version on the server\.
.
.P
Setting a global value for config_version in puppet\.conf is not allowed (but it can be overridden from the commandline)\. Please set a per\-environment value in environment\.conf instead\. For more info, see \fIhttps://puppet\.com/docs/puppet/latest/environments_about\.html\fR
.
.SS "configprint"
Prints the value of a specific configuration setting\. If the name of a setting is provided for this, then the value is printed and puppet exits\. Comma\-separate multiple values\. For a list of all values, specify \'all\'\. This setting is deprecated, the \'puppet config\' command replaces this functionality\.
.
.SS "crl_refresh_interval"
How often the Puppet agent refreshes its local Certificate Revocation List (CRL)\. By default, the CRL is refreshed every 24 hours\. If a different interval is specified, the agent refreshes its CRL on the next Puppet agent run if the elapsed time since the CRL was last refreshed exceeds the specified interval\.
.
.P
In general, the interval should be greater than the \fBruninterval\fR value\. Setting the \fBcrl_refresh_interval\fR value to 0 or an equal or lesser value than \fBruninterval\fR causes the CRL to be refreshed on every run\.
.
.P
If the agent downloads a new CRL, the agent will use it for subsequent network requests\. If the refresh request fails or if the CRL is unchanged on the server, then the agent run will continue using the local CRL it already has\.This setting can be a time interval in seconds (30 or 30s), minutes (30m), hours (6h), days (2d), or years (5y)\.

.SS "csr_attributes"
An optional file containing custom attributes to add to certificate signing requests (CSRs)\. You should ensure that this file does not exist on your CA Puppet Server; if it does, unwanted certificate extensions may leak into certificates created with the \fBpuppetserver ca generate\fR command\.
.
.P
If present, this file must be a YAML hash containing a \fBcustom_attributes\fR key and/or an \fBextension_requests\fR key\. The value of each key must be a hash, where each key is a valid OID and each value is an object that can be cast to a string\.
.
.P
Custom attributes can be used by the CA when deciding whether to sign the certificate, but are then discarded\. Attribute OIDs can be any OID value except the standard CSR attributes (i\.e\. attributes described in RFC 2985 section 5\.4)\. This is useful for embedding a pre\-shared key for autosigning policy executables (see the \fBautosign\fR setting), often by using the \fB1\.2\.840\.113549\.1\.9\.7\fR ("challenge password") OID\.
.
.P
Extension requests will be permanently embedded in the final certificate\. Extension OIDs must be in the "ppRegCertExt" (\fB1\.3\.6\.1\.4\.1\.34380\.1\.1\fR), "ppPrivCertExt" (\fB1\.3\.6\.1\.4\.1\.34380\.1\.2\fR), or "ppAuthCertExt" (\fB1\.3\.6\.1\.4\.1\.34380\.1\.3\fR) OID arcs\. The ppRegCertExt arc is reserved for four of the most common pieces of data to embed: \fBpp_uuid\fR (\fB\.1\fR), \fBpp_instance_id\fR (\fB\.2\fR), \fBpp_image_name\fR (\fB\.3\fR), and \fBpp_preshared_key\fR (\fB\.4\fR) \-\-\- in the YAML file, these can be referred to by their short descriptive names instead of their full OID\. The ppPrivCertExt arc is unregulated, and can be used for site\-specific extensions\. The ppAuthCert arc is reserved for two pieces of data to embed: \fBpp_authorization\fR (\fB\.1\fR) and \fBpp_auth_role\fR (\fB\.13\fR)\. As with ppRegCertExt, in the YAML file, these can be referred to by their short descriptive name instead of their full OID\.

.SS "dns_alt_names"
A comma\-separated list of alternate DNS names for Puppet Server\. These are extra hostnames (in addition to its \fBcertname\fR) that the server is allowed to use when serving agents\. Puppet checks this setting when automatically creating a certificate for Puppet agent or Puppet Server\. These can be either IP or DNS, and the type should be specified and followed with a colon\. Untyped inputs will default to DNS\.
.
.P
In order to handle agent requests at a given hostname (like "puppet\.example\.com"), Puppet Server needs a certificate that proves it\'s allowed to use that name; if a server shows a certificate that doesn\'t include its hostname, Puppet agents will refuse to trust it\. If you use a single hostname for Puppet traffic but load\-balance it to multiple Puppet Servers, each of those servers needs to include the official hostname in its list of extra names\.
.
.P
\fBNote:\fR The list of alternate names is locked in when the server\'s certificate is signed\. If you need to change the list later, you can\'t just change this setting; you also need to regenerate the certificate\. For more information on that process, see the cert regen docs \fIhttps://puppet\.com/docs/puppet/latest/ssl_regenerate_certificates\.html\fR\.
.
.P
To see all the alternate names your servers are using, log into your CA server and run \fBpuppetserver ca list \-\-all\fR, then check the output for \fB(alt names: \.\.\.)\fR\. Most agent nodes should NOT have alternate names; the only certs that should have them are Puppet Server nodes that you want other agents to trust\.

.SS "environment"
The environment in which Puppet is running\. For clients, such as \fBpuppet agent\fR, this determines the environment itself, which Puppet uses to find modules and much more\. For servers, such as \fBpuppet server\fR, this provides the default environment for nodes that Puppet knows nothing about\.
.
.P
When defining an environment in the \fB[agent]\fR section, this refers to the environment that the agent requests from the primary server\. The environment doesn\'t have to exist on the local filesystem because the agent fetches it from the primary server\. This definition is used when running \fBpuppet agent\fR\.
.
.P
When defined in the \fB[user]\fR section, the environment refers to the path that Puppet uses to search for code and modules related to its execution\. This requires the environment to exist locally on the filesystem where puppet is being executed\. Puppet subcommands, including \fBpuppet module\fR and \fBpuppet apply\fR, use this definition\.
.
.P
Given that the context and effects vary depending on the config section \fIhttps://puppet\.com/docs/puppet/latest/config_file_main\.html#config\-sections\fR in which the \fBenvironment\fR setting is defined, do not set it globally\.

A value of \fB0\fR will disable caching\. This setting can also be set to \fBunlimited\fR, which will cache environments until the server is restarted or told to refresh the cache\. All other values will result in Puppet server evicting environments that haven\'t been used within the last \fBenvironment_timeout\fR seconds\.
.
.P
You should change this setting once your Puppet deployment is doing non\-trivial work\. We chose the default value of \fB0\fR because it lets new users update their code without any extra steps, but it lowers the performance of your Puppet server\. We recommend either:
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Setting this to \fBunlimited\fR and explicitly refreshing your Puppet server as part of your code deployment process\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Setting this to a number that will keep your most actively used environments cached, but allow testing environments to fall out of the cache and reduce memory usage\. A value of 3 minutes (3m) is a reasonable value\.
.

.P
Once you set \fBenvironment_timeout\fR to a non\-zero value, you need to tell Puppet server to read new code from disk using the \fBenvironment\-cache\fR API endpoint after you deploy new code\.

.SS "noop"
Whether to apply catalogs in noop mode, which allows Puppet to partially simulate a normal run\. This setting affects puppet agent and puppet apply\.
.
.P
When running in noop mode, Puppet will check whether each resource is in sync, like it does when running normally\. However, if a resource attribute is not in the desired state (as declared in the catalog), Puppet will take no action, and will instead report the changes it \fIwould\fR have made\. These simulated changes will appear in the report sent to the primary Puppet server, or be shown on the console if running puppet agent or puppet apply in the foreground\. The simulated changes will not send refresh events to any subscribing or notified resources, although Puppet will log that a refresh event \fIwould\fR have been sent\.

\fBImportant note:\fR The \fBnoop\fR metaparameter \fIhttps://puppet\.com/docs/puppet/latest/metaparameter\.html#noop\fR allows you to apply individual resources in noop mode, and will override the global value of the \fBnoop\fR setting\.

The header containing an authenticated client\'s SSL DN\. This header must be set by the proxy to the authenticated client\'s SSL DN (e\.g\., \fB/CN=puppet\.puppetlabs\.com\fR)\. Puppet will parse out the Common Name (CN) from the Distinguished Name (DN) and use the value of the CN field for authorization\.

This setting affects the usage of \fBschedule\fR resources, as the information about when a resource was last checked (and therefore when it needs to be checked again) is stored in the \fBstatefile\fR\. The \fBstatettl\fR needs to be large enough to ensure that a resource will not trigger multiple times during a schedule due to its entry expiring from the cache\.

Whether to only use the cached catalog rather than compiling a new catalog on every run\. Puppet can be run with this enabled by default and then selectively disabled when a recompile is desired\.

When starting for the first time, puppet agent will submit a certificate signing request (CSR) to the server named in the \fBca_server\fR setting (usually the primary Puppet server); this may be autosigned, or may need to be approved by a human, depending on the CA server\'s configuration\.
.
.P
Puppet agent cannot apply configurations until its approved certificate is available\. Since the certificate may or may not be available immediately, puppet agent will repeatedly try to fetch it at this interval\. You can turn off waiting for certificates by specifying a time of 0, or a maximum amount of time to wait in the \fBmaxwaitforcert\fR setting, in which case puppet agent will exit if it cannot get a cert\.
