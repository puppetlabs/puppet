          this provides the default environment for nodes that Puppet knows nothing about.

        will always attempt to load the type or feature (which can be an
        expensive operation) unless it has already been loaded successfully.
        This makes it possible for a single agent run to, e.g., install a
        package that provides the underlying capabilities for a type or feature,
        and then later load that type or feature during the same run (even if
        the type or feature had been tested earlier and had not been available).

        If this setting is set to false, then types and features will only be
        checked once, and if they are not available, the negative result is
        cached and returned for all subsequent attempts to load the type or
        feature.  This behavior is almost always appropriate for the server,
        and can result in a significant performance improvement for types and
        features that are checked frequently.

        Which node data plugin to use when compiling node catalogs.

        When Puppet compiles a catalog, it combines two primary sources of info: the main manifest,
        and a node data plugin (often called a "node terminus," for historical reasons). Node data
        plugins provide three things for a given node name:

        1. A list of classes to add to that node's catalog (and, optionally, values for their
           parameters).
        2. Which Puppet environment the node should use.
        3. A list of additional top-scope variables to set.

        The three main node data plugins are:

        * `plain` --- Returns no data, so that the main manifest controls all node configuration.
        * `exec` --- Uses an
          [external node classifier (ENC)](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/nodes_external.html),
          configured by the `external_nodes` setting. This lets you pull a list of Puppet classes
          from any external system, using a small glue script to perform the request and format the
          result as YAML.
        * `classifier` (formerly `console`) --- Specific to Puppet Enterprise. Uses the PE console
          for node data."

      You should change this setting once your Puppet deployment is doing

      * Setting this to a number that will keep your most actively used

        cache and reduce memory usage. A value of 3 minutes (3m) is a reasonable
        value.

serving agents. Puppet checks this setting when automatically creating a
certificate for Puppet agent or Puppet Server. These can be either IP or DNS, and the type
should be specified and followed with a colon. Untyped inputs will default to DNS.

In order to handle agent requests at a given hostname (like
"puppet.example.com"), Puppet Server needs a certificate that proves it's
allowed to use that name; if a server shows a certificate that doesn't include
its hostname, Puppet agents will refuse to trust it. If you use a single
hostname for Puppet traffic but load-balance it to multiple Puppet Servers, each
of those servers needs to include the official hostname in its list of extra
names.

**Note:** The list of alternate names is locked in when the server's
certificate is signed. If you need to change the list later, you can't just
change this setting; you also need to regenerate the certificate. For more
information on that process, see the 
[cert regen docs](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/ssl_regenerate_certificates.html).

To see all the alternate names your servers are using, log into your CA server
and run `puppetserver ca list --all`, then check the output for `(alt names: ...)`.
Most agent nodes should NOT have alternate names; the only certs that should
have them are Puppet Server nodes that you want other agents to trust.

An optional file containing custom attributes to add to certificate signing
requests (CSRs). You should ensure that this file does not exist on your CA
Puppet Server; if it does, unwanted certificate extensions may leak into
certificates created with the `puppetserver ca generate` command.

If present, this file must be a YAML hash containing a `custom_attributes` key
and/or an `extension_requests` key. The value of each key must be a hash, where
each key is a valid OID and each value is an object that can be cast to a string.

Custom attributes can be used by the CA when deciding whether to sign the
certificate, but are then discarded. Attribute OIDs can be any OID value except
the standard CSR attributes (i.e. attributes described in RFC 2985 section 5.4).
This is useful for embedding a pre-shared key for autosigning policy executables
(see the `autosign` setting), often by using the `1.2.840.113549.1.9.7`
("challenge password") OID.

Extension requests will be permanently embedded in the final certificate.
Extension OIDs must be in the "ppRegCertExt" (`1.3.6.1.4.1.34380.1.1`),
"ppPrivCertExt" (`1.3.6.1.4.1.34380.1.2`), or
"ppAuthCertExt" (`1.3.6.1.4.1.34380.1.3`) OID arcs. The ppRegCertExt arc is
reserved for four of the most common pieces of data to embed: `pp_uuid` (`.1`),
`pp_instance_id` (`.2`), `pp_image_name` (`.3`), and `pp_preshared_key` (`.4`)
--- in the YAML file, these can be referred to by their short descriptive names
instead of their full OID. The ppPrivCertExt arc is unregulated, and can be used
for site-specific extensions. The ppAuthCert arc is reserved for two pieces of
data to embed: `pp_authorization` (`.1`) and `pp_auth_role` (`.13`). As with
ppRegCertExt, in the YAML file, these can be referred to by their short
descriptive name instead of their full OID.

          When certificate revocation is enabled, Puppet expects the contents of its CRL
          to be one or more PEM-encoded CRLs concatenated together. When using a cert
          bundle, CRLs for all CAs in the chain of trust must be included in the crl file.
          The chain should be ordered from least to most authoritative, with the first CRL
          listed being for the root of the chain and the last being for the leaf CA.

          When certificate_revocation is set to 'true' or 'chain', Puppet ensures
          that each CA in the chain of trust has not been revoked by its issuing CA.

          When certificate_revocation is set to 'leaf', Puppet verifies certs against
          the issuing CA's revocation list, but it does not verify the revocation status
          of the issuing CA or any CA above it within the chain of trust.

          When certificate_revocation is set to 'false', Puppet disables all
          certificate revocation checking and does not attempt to download the CRL.

        The file specified in this setting may be either a **configuration file**

        treated as a config file.

        If a custom policy executable is configured, the CA Puppet Server will run it
        every time it receives a CSR. The executable will be passed the subject CN of the
        request _as a command line argument,_ and the contents of the CSR in PEM format
