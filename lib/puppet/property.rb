# The Property class is the implementation of a resource's attributes of _property_ kind.
# A Property is a specialized Resource Type Parameter that has both an 'is' (current) state, and
# a 'should' (wanted state). However, even if this is conceptually true, the current _is_ value is
# obtained by asking the associated provider for the value, and hence it is not actually part of a
# property's state, and only available when a provider has been selected and can obtain the value (i.e. when
# running on an agent).
#
# A Property (also in contrast to a parameter) is intended to describe a managed attribute of
# some system entity, such as the name or mode of a file.
#
# The current value _(is)_ is read and written with the methods {#retrieve} and {#set}, and the wanted
# value _(should)_ is read and written with the methods {#value} and {#value=} which delegate to
# {#should} and {#should=}, i.e. when a property is used like any other parameter, it is the _should_ value
# that is operated on.
#
# All resource type properties in the puppet system are derived from this class.
#
# The intention is that new parameters are created by using the DSL method {Puppet::Type.newproperty}.
#
# @abstract
# @note Properties of Types are expressed using subclasses of this class. Such a class describes one
#   named property of a particular Type (as opposed to describing a type of property in general). This
#   limits the use of one (concrete) property class instance to occur only once for a given type's inheritance
#   chain. An instance of a Property class is the value holder of one instance of the resource type (e.g. the
#   mode of a file resource instance).
#   A Property class may server as the superclass _(parent)_ of another; e.g. a Size property that describes
#   handling of measurements such as kb, mb, gb. If a type requires two different size measurements it requires
#   one concrete class per such measure; e.g. MinSize (:parent => Size), and MaxSize (:parent => Size).

    #
    # @comment there are two blank chars after the symbols to cause a break - do not remove these.
    # * `:first`
    #   This is primarily used for single value properties. When matched against an array of values
    #   a match is true if the `is` value matches any of the values in the `should` array. When the `is` value
    #   is also an array, the matching is performed against the entire array as the `is` value.
    # * `:all`
    #   : This is primarily used for multi-valued properties. When matched against an array of
    #     `should` values, the size of `is` and `should` must be the same, and all values in `is` must match
    #     a value in `should`.
