      Define schedules for Puppet. Resources can be limited to a schedule by using the
      [`schedule`](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/metaparameter.html#schedule)
      metaparameter.

      Currently, **schedules can only be used to stop a resource from being
      applied;** they cannot cause a resource to be applied when it otherwise
      wouldn't be, and they cannot accurately specify a time when a resource
      should run.

      Every time Puppet applies its configuration, it will apply the
      set of resources whose schedule does not eliminate them from
      running right then, but there is currently no system in place to
      guarantee that a given resource runs at a given time.  If you
      specify a very  restrictive schedule and Puppet happens to run at a
      time within that schedule, then the resources will get applied;
      otherwise, that work may never get done.

      Thus, it is advisable to use wider scheduling (for example, over a couple
      of hours) combined with periods and repetitions.  For instance, if you
      wanted to restrict certain resources to only running once, between
      the hours of two and 4 AM, then you would use this schedule:

          schedule { 'maint':
            range  => '2 - 4',
            period => daily,
            repeat => 1,
          }

      With this schedule, the first time that Puppet runs between 2 and 4 AM,
      all resources with this schedule will get applied, but they won't
      get applied again between 2 and 4 because they will have already
      run once that day, and they won't get applied outside that schedule
      because they will be outside the scheduled range.

      Puppet automatically creates a schedule for each of the valid periods
      with the same name as that period (such as hourly and daily).
      Additionally, a schedule named `puppet` is created and used as the
      default, with the following attributes:

          schedule { 'puppet':
            period => hourly,
            repeat => 2,
          }

      This will cause resources to be applied every 30 minutes by default.

      The `statettl` setting on the agent affects the ability of a schedule to
      determine if a resource has already been checked. If the `statettl` is
      set lower than the span of the associated schedule resource, then a
      resource could be checked & applied multiple times in the schedule as
      the information about when the resource was last checked will have
      expired from the cache.

    newparam(:name) do
      desc <<-EOT
        The name of the schedule.  This name is used when assigning the schedule
        to a resource with the `schedule` metaparameter:

            schedule { 'everyday':
              period => daily,
              range  => '2 - 4',
            }

            exec { '/usr/bin/apt-get update':
              schedule => 'everyday',
            }

        EOT
      isnamevar
    end

    newparam(:range) do
      desc <<-EOT
        The earliest and latest that a resource can be applied.  This is
        always a hyphen-separated range within a 24 hour period, and hours
        must be specified in numbers between 0 and 23, inclusive.  Minutes and
        seconds can optionally be provided, using the normal colon as a
        separator. For instance:

            schedule { 'maintenance':
              range => '1:30 - 4:30',
            }

        This is mostly useful for restricting certain resources to being
        applied in maintenance windows or during off-peak hours. Multiple
        ranges can be applied in array context. As a convenience when specifying
        ranges, you can cross midnight (for example, `range => "22:00 - 04:00"`).

    newparam(:period) do
      desc <<-EOT
        The period of repetition for resources on this schedule. The default is
        for resources to get applied every time Puppet runs.

        Note that the period defines how often a given resource will get
        applied but not when; if you would like to restrict the hours
        that a given resource can be applied (for instance, only at night
        during a maintenance window), then use the `range` attribute.

        If the provided periods are not sufficient, you can provide a
        value to the *repeat* attribute, which will cause Puppet to
        schedule the affected resources evenly in the period the
        specified number of times.  Take this schedule:

            schedule { 'veryoften':
              period => hourly,
              repeat => 6,
            }

        This can cause Puppet to apply that resource up to every 10 minutes.

        At the moment, Puppet cannot guarantee that level of repetition; that
        is, the resource can applied _up to_ every 10 minutes, but internal
        factors might prevent it from actually running that often (for instance,
        if a Puppet run is still in progress when the next run is scheduled to
        start, that next run will be suppressed).

        See the `periodmatch` attribute for tuning whether to match
        times by their distance apart or by their specific value.
        
        > **Tip**: You can use `period => never,` to prevent a resource from being applied
        in the given `range`. This is useful if you need to create a blackout window to
        perform sensitive operations without interruption.
