    @doc = "Manage packages.  There is a basic dichotomy in package
      support right now:  Some package types (such as yum and apt) can
      retrieve their own package files, while others (such as rpm and sun)
      cannot.  For those package formats that cannot retrieve their own files,
      you can use the `source` parameter to point to the correct file.

      Puppet will automatically guess the packaging format that you are
      using based on the platform you are on, but you can override it
      using the `provider` parameter; each provider defines what it
      requires in order to function, and you must meet those requirements
      to use a given provider.

      You can declare multiple package resources with the same `name` as long
      as they have unique titles, and specify different providers and commands.

      Note that you must use the _title_ to make a reference to a package
      resource; `Package[<NAME>]` is not a synonym for `Package[<TITLE>]` like
      it is for many other resource types.

      **Autorequires:** If Puppet is managing the files specified as a
      package's `adminfile`, `responsefile`, or `source`, the package
      resource will autorequire those files."

        What state the package should be in. On packaging systems that can
        retrieve new packages on their own, you can choose which package to
        retrieve by specifying a version number or `latest` as the ensure
        value. On packaging systems that manage configuration files separately
        from "normal" system files, you can uninstall config files by
        specifying `purged` as the ensure value. This defaults to `installed`.

        Version numbers must match the full version to install, including
        release if the provider uses a release moniker. For
        example, to install the bash package from the rpm
        `bash-4.1.2-29.el6.x86_64.rpm`, use the string `'4.1.2-29.el6'`.

        On supported providers, version ranges can also be ensured. For example,
        inequalities: `<2.0.0`, or intersections: `>1.0.0 <2.0.0`.

        An array of additional options to pass when uninstalling a package. These
        options are package-specific, and should be documented by the software
        vendor.  For example:

            package { 'VMware Tools':
              ensure            => absent,
              uninstall_options => [ { 'REMOVE' => 'Sync,VSS' } ],
            }

        Each option in the array can either be a string or a hash, where each
        key and value pair are interpreted in a provider specific way.  Each
        option will automatically be quoted when passed to the uninstall
        command.

        On Windows, this is the **only** place in Puppet where backslash
        separators should be used.  Note that backslashes in double-quoted
        strings _must_ be double-escaped and backslashes in single-quoted
        strings _may_ be double-escaped.
