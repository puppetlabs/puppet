          hashes. You can use Puppet's built-in `sha1` function to generate a salted SHA1
          hash from a password.
        * Mac OS X 10.7 (Lion), and many recent Linux distributions, use salted SHA512
          hashes. The Puppet Labs [stdlib][] module contains a `str2saltedsha512` function
          which can generate password hashes for these operating systems.
        * OS X 10.8 and higher use salted SHA512 PBKDF2 hashes. When managing passwords
          on these systems, the `salt` and `iterations` attributes need to be specified as
          well as the password.
        * Windows passwords can be managed only in cleartext, because there is no Windows
          API for setting the password hash.

        [stdlib]: https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-stdlib/

        Enclose any value that includes a dollar sign ($) in single quotes (') to avoid
        accidental variable interpolation.

        To redact passwords from reports to PuppetDB, use the `Sensitive` data type. For
        example, this resource protects the password:

        ```puppet
        user { 'foo':
          ensure   => present,
          password => Sensitive("my secret password")
        }
        ```

        This results in the password being redacted from the report, as in the
        `previous_value`, `desired_value`, and `message` fields below.

        ```yaml
            events:
