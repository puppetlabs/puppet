module Puppet
  Puppet::Type.type(:file).newproperty(:mode) do
    require_relative '../../../puppet/util/symbolic_file_mode'
    include Puppet::Util::SymbolicFileMode

    desc <<-'EOT'
      The desired permissions mode for the file, in symbolic or numeric
      notation. This value **must** be specified as a string; do not use
      un-quoted numbers to represent file modes.

      If the mode is omitted (or explicitly set to `undef`), Puppet does not
      enforce permissions on existing files and creates new files with
      permissions of `0644`.

      The `file` type uses traditional Unix permission schemes and translates
      them to equivalent permissions for systems which represent permissions
      differently, including Windows. For detailed ACL controls on Windows,
      you can leave `mode` unmanaged and use
      [the puppetlabs/acl module.](https://forge.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs/acl)

      Numeric modes should use the standard octal notation of
      `<SETUID/SETGID/STICKY><OWNER><GROUP><OTHER>` (for example, "0644").

      * Each of the "owner," "group," and "other" digits should be a sum of the
        permissions for that class of users, where read = 4, write = 2, and
        execute/search = 1.
      * The setuid/setgid/sticky digit is also a sum, where setuid = 4, setgid = 2,
        and sticky = 1.
      * The setuid/setgid/sticky digit is optional. If it is absent, Puppet will
        clear any existing setuid/setgid/sticky permissions. (So to make your intent
        clear, you should use at least four digits for numeric modes.)
      * When specifying numeric permissions for directories, Puppet sets the search
        permission wherever the read permission is set.

      Symbolic modes should be represented as a string of comma-separated
      permission clauses, in the form `<WHO><OP><PERM>`:

      * "Who" should be any combination of u (user), g (group), and o (other), or a (all)
      * "Op" should be = (set exact permissions), + (add select permissions),
        or - (remove select permissions)
      * "Perm" should be one or more of:
          * r (read)
          * w (write)
          * x (execute/search)
          * t (sticky)
          * s (setuid/setgid)
          * X (execute/search if directory or if any one user can execute)
          * u (user's current permissions)
          * g (group's current permissions)
          * o (other's current permissions)

      Thus, mode `"0664"` could be represented symbolically as either `a=r,ug+w`
      or `ug=rw,o=r`.  However, symbolic modes are more expressive than numeric
      modes: a mode only affects the specified bits, so `mode => 'ug+w'` will
      set the user and group write bits, without affecting any other bits.

      See the manual page for GNU or BSD `chmod` for more details
      on numeric and symbolic modes.

      On Windows, permissions are translated as follows:

      * Owner and group names are mapped to Windows SIDs
      * The "other" class of users maps to the "Everyone" SID
      * The read/write/execute permissions map to the `FILE_GENERIC_READ`,
        `FILE_GENERIC_WRITE`, and `FILE_GENERIC_EXECUTE` access rights; a
        file's owner always has the `FULL_CONTROL` right
      * "Other" users can't have any permissions a file's group lacks,
        and its group can't have any permissions its owner lacks; that is, "0644"
        is an acceptable mode, but "0464" is not.
