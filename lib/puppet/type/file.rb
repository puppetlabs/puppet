    The `file` type can manage normal files, directories, and symlinks; the
    type should be specified in the `ensure` attribute.

    File contents can be managed directly with the `content` attribute, or
    downloaded from a remote source using the `source` attribute; the latter
    can also be used to recursively serve directories (when the `recurse`
    attribute is set to `true` or `local`). On Windows, note that file
    contents are managed in binary mode; Puppet never automatically translates
    line endings.

    **Autorequires:** If Puppet is managing the user or group that owns a
    file, the file resource will autorequire them. If Puppet is managing any
    parent directories of a file, the file resource autorequires them.

    Warning: Enabling `recurse` on directories containing large numbers of
    files slows agent runs. To manage file attributes for many files,
    consider using alternative methods such as the `chmod_r`, `chown_r`,
     or `recursive_file_permissions` modules from the Forge."

      Whether (and how) file content should be backed up before being replaced.
      This attribute works best as a resource default in the site manifest
      (`File { backup => main }`), so it can affect all file resources.

      * If set to `false`, file content won't be backed up.
      * If set to a string beginning with `.`, such as `.puppet-bak`, Puppet will
        use copy the file in the same directory with that value as the extension
        of the backup. (A value of `true` is a synonym for `.puppet-bak`.)
      * If set to any other string, Puppet will try to back up to a filebucket
        with that title. Puppet automatically creates a **local** filebucket
        named `puppet` if one doesn't already exist. See the `filebucket` resource
        type for more details.

      Default value: `false`

      Backing up to a local filebucket isn't particularly useful. If you want
      to make organized use of backups, you will generally want to use the
      primary Puppet server's filebucket service. This requires declaring a
      filebucket resource and a resource default for the `backup` attribute
      in site.pp:

          # /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/manifests/site.pp
          filebucket { 'main':
            path   => false,                # This is required for remote filebuckets.
            server => 'puppet.example.com', # Optional; defaults to the configured primary Puppet server.
          }

          File { backup => main, }

      If you are using multiple primary servers, you will want to
      centralize the contents of the filebucket. Either configure your load
      balancer to direct all filebucket traffic to a single primary server, or use
      something like an out-of-band rsync task to synchronize the content on all
      primary servers.

      > **Note**: Enabling and using the backup option, and by extension the 
        filebucket resource, requires appropriate planning and management to ensure 
        that sufficient disk space is available for the file backups. Generally, you 
        can implement this using one of the following two options:
        - Use a `find` command and `crontab` entry to retain only the last X days 
        of file backups. For example:
        
        ```
        find /opt/puppetlabs/server/data/puppetserver/bucket -type f -mtime +45 -atime +45 -print0 | xargs -0 rm
        ```
        
        - Restrict the directory to a maximum size after which the oldest items are removed.

        automatically managed.
      * `remote` --- If the `source` attribute is set, Puppet will automatically
        manage the contents of the source directory (or directories), ensuring
        that equivalent files and directories exist on the target system and
        that their contents match.

        Using `remote` will disable the `purge` attribute, but results in faster
        catalog application than `recurse => true`.

        The `source` attribute is mandatory when `recurse => remote`.
      * `true` --- If the `source` attribute is set, this behaves similarly to
        `recurse => remote`, automatically managing files from the source directory.

        This also enables the `purge` attribute, which can delete unmanaged
        files from a directory. See the description of `purge` for more details.

        The `source` attribute is not mandatory when using `recurse => true`, so you
        can enable purging in directories where all files are managed individually.

      By default, setting recurse to `remote` or `true` will manage _all_
