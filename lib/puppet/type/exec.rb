    @doc = "Executes external commands.

      Any command in an `exec` resource **must** be able to run multiple times
      without causing harm --- that is, it must be *idempotent*. There are three
      main ways for an exec to be idempotent:

      * The command itself is already idempotent. (For example, `apt-get update`.)
      * The exec has an `onlyif`, `unless`, or `creates` attribute, which prevents
        Puppet from running the command unless some condition is met. The
        `onlyif` and `unless` commands of an `exec` are used in the process of
        determining whether the `exec` is already in sync, therefore they must be run
        during a noop Puppet run.
      * The exec has `refreshonly => true`, which allows Puppet to run the
        command only when some other resource is changed. (See the notes on refreshing
        below.) 
        
      The state managed by an `exec` resource represents whether the specified command
      _needs to be_ executed during the catalog run. The target state is always that
      the command does not need to be executed. If the initial state is that the
      command _does_ need to be executed, then successfully executing the command
      transitions it to the target state.
      
      The `unless`, `onlyif`, and `creates` properties check the initial state of the
      resource. If one or more of these properties is specified, the exec might not
      need to run. If the exec does not need to run, then the system is already in
      the target state. In such cases, the exec is considered successful without 
      actually executing its command.

      A caution: There's a widespread tendency to use collections of execs to
      manage resources that aren't covered by an existing resource type. This
      works fine for simple tasks, but once your exec pile gets complex enough
      that you really have to think to understand what's happening, you should
      consider developing a custom resource type instead, as it is much
      more predictable and maintainable.

      **Duplication:** Even though `command` is the namevar, Puppet allows
      multiple `exec` resources with the same `command` value.

      **Refresh:** `exec` resources can respond to refresh events (via
      `notify`, `subscribe`, or the `~>` arrow). The refresh behavior of execs
      is non-standard, and can be affected by the `refresh` and
      `refreshonly` attributes:

      * If `refreshonly` is set to true, the exec runs _only_ when it receives an
        event. This is the most reliable way to use refresh with execs.
      * If the exec has already run and then receives an event, it runs its
        command **up to two times.** If an `onlyif`, `unless`, or `creates` condition
        is no longer met after the first run, the second run does not occur.
      * If the exec has already run, has a `refresh` command, and receives an
        event, it runs its normal command. Then, if any `onlyif`, `unless`, or `creates`
        conditions are still met, the exec runs its `refresh` command.
      * If the exec has an `onlyif`, `unless`, or `creates` attribute that prevents it
        from running, and it then receives an event, it still will not run.
      * If the exec has `noop => true`, would otherwise have run, and receives
        an event from a non-noop resource, it runs once. However, if it has a `refresh`
        command, it runs that instead of its normal command.

      In short: If there's a possibility of your exec receiving refresh events,
      it is extremely important to make sure the run conditions are restricted.

      **Autorequires:** If Puppet is managing an exec's cwd or the executable
      file used in an exec's command, the exec resource autorequires those
      files. If Puppet is managing the user that an exec should run as, the
      exec resource autorequires that user."

        executed command has some other exit code. Can be specified as an array
        of acceptable exit codes or a single value.

        On POSIX systems, exit codes are always integers between 0 and 255.

        On Windows, **most** exit codes should be integers between 0
        and 2147483647.

        Larger exit codes on Windows can behave inconsistently across different
        tools. The Win32 APIs define exit codes as 32-bit unsigned integers, but
        both the cmd.exe shell and the .NET runtime cast them to signed
        integers. This means some tools will report negative numbers for exit
        codes above 2147483647. (For example, cmd.exe reports 4294967295 as -1.)
        Since Puppet uses the plain Win32 APIs, it will report the very large
        number instead of the negative number, which might not be what you
        expect if you got the exit code from a cmd.exe session.

        Microsoft recommends against using negative/very large exit codes, and
        you should avoid them when possible. To convert a negative exit code to
        the positive one Puppet will use, add it to 4294967296."

        `exec` is already in sync, it must be run during a noop Puppet run.

        This parameter can also take an array of commands. For example:

            onlyif => ['test -f /tmp/file1', 'test -f /tmp/file2'],

        or an array of arrays. For example:

            onlyif => [['test', '-f', '/tmp/file1'], 'test -f /tmp/file2']

        This `exec` would only run if every command in the array has an
        exit code of 0 (success).
