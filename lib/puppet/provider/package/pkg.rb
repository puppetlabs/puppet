  # A few notes before we start:
  # Opensolaris pkg has two slightly different formats (as of now.)
  # The first one is what is distributed with the Solaris 11 Express 11/10 dvd
  # The latest one is what you get when you update package.
  # To make things more interesting, pkg version just returns a sha sum.
  # dvd:     pkg version => 052adf36c3f4
  # updated: pkg version => 630e1ffc7a19
  # Thankfully, Solaris has not changed the commands to be used.
  # TODO: We still have to allow packages to specify a preferred publisher.
