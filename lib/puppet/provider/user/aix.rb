# User Puppet provider for AIX. It uses standard commands to manage users:
#  mkuser, rmuser, lsuser, chuser
#
# Notes:
# - AIX users can have expiry date defined with minute granularity,
#   but Puppet does not allow it. There is a ticket open for that (#5431)
#
# - AIX maximum password age is in WEEKs, not days
#
# See https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/provider_development.html
