  desc <<-'EOT'
    This provider manages jobs with `launchd`, which is the default service
    framework for Mac OS X (and may be available for use on other platforms).

    For more information, see the `launchd` man page:

    * <https://developer.apple.com/legacy/library/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man8/launchd.8.html>

    This provider reads plists out of the following directories:

    * `/System/Library/LaunchDaemons`
    * `/System/Library/LaunchAgents`
    * `/Library/LaunchDaemons`
    * `/Library/LaunchAgents`

    ...and builds up a list of services based upon each plist's "Label" entry.

    This provider supports:

    * ensure => running/stopped,
    * enable => true/false
    * status
    * restart

    Here is how the Puppet states correspond to `launchd` states:

    * stopped --- job unloaded
    * started --- job loaded
    * enabled --- 'Disable' removed from job plist file
    * disabled --- 'Disable' added to job plist file

    Note that this allows you to do something `launchctl` can't do, which is to
    be in a state of "stopped/enabled" or "running/disabled".

    Note that this provider does not support overriding 'restart'
