# Solaris 10 SMF-style services.
Puppet::Type.type(:service).provide :smf, :parent => :base do
  desc <<-EOT
    Support for Sun's new Service Management Framework.

    When managing the enable property, this provider will try to preserve
    the previous ensure state per the enableable semantics. On Solaris,
    enabling a service starts it up while disabling a service stops it. Thus,
    there's a chance for this provider to execute two operations when managing
    the enable property. For example, if enable is set to true and the ensure
    state is stopped, this provider will manage the service using two operations:
    one to enable the service which will start it up, and another to stop the
    service (without affecting its enabled status).

    By specifying `manifest => "/path/to/service.xml"`, the SMF manifest will
    be imported if it does not exist.
