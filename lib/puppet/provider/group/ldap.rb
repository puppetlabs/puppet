    This provider requires that you have valid values for all of the
    LDAP-related settings in `puppet.conf`, including `ldapbase`.  You will
    almost definitely need settings for `ldapuser` and `ldappassword` in order
    for your clients to write to LDAP.

    Note that this provider will automatically generate a GID for you if you do
    not specify one, but it is a potentially expensive operation, as it
    iterates across all existing groups to pick the appropriate next one."
