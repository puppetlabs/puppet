# Wrapper around Ruby Etc module allowing us to manage encoding in a single
# place.
# This represents a subset of Ruby's Etc module, only the methods required by Puppet.

# On Ruby 2.1.0 and later, Etc returns strings in variable encoding depending on
# environment. The string returned will be labeled with the environment's
# encoding (Encoding.default_external), with one exception: If the environment
# encoding is 7-bit ASCII, and any individual character bit representation is
# equal to or greater than 128 - \x80 - 0b10000000 - signifying the smallest
# 8-bit big-endian value, the returned string will be in BINARY encoding instead
# of environment encoding.
#
# Barring that exception, the returned string will be labeled as encoding
# Encoding.default_external, regardless of validity or byte-width. For example,
# ruby will label a string containing a four-byte characters such as "\u{2070E}"
# as EUC_KR even though EUC_KR is a two-byte width encoding.
#
# On Ruby 2.0.x and earlier, Etc will always return string values in BINARY,
# ignoring encoding altogether.
#
# For Puppet we specifically want UTF-8 as our input from the Etc module - which
# is our input for many resource instance 'is' values. The associated 'should'
# value will basically always be coming from Puppet in UTF-8 - and written to
# disk as UTF-8. Etc is defined for Windows but the majority calls to it return
# nil and Puppet does not use it.
#
# That being said, we have cause to retain the original, pre-override string
# values. `puppet resource user`
# (Puppet::Resource::User.indirection.search('User', {})) uses self.instances to
# query for user(s) and then iterates over the results of that query again to
# obtain state for each user. If we've overridden the original user name and not
# retained the original, we've lost the ability to query the system for it
# later. Hence the Puppet::Etc::Passwd and Puppet::Etc::Group structs.
#
# We only use Etc for retrieving existing property values from the system. For
# setting property values, providers leverage system tools (i.e., `useradd`)
