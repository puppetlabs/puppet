  # and to only convert the lexer's internal tokens on demand. It is slightly more costly to create an
  # instance of a class defined in Ruby than an Array or Hash, but the gain is much bigger since transformation
  # logic is avoided for many of its members (most are never used (e.g. line/pos information which is only of
  # value in general for error messages, and for some expressions (which the lexer does not know about).

    # This makes a small but notable difference since instance member access is avoided for

  # A scanner specialized in processing text with embedded EPP (Embedded Puppet) tags.
  # The scanner is initialized with a StringScanner which it mutates as scanning takes place.
  # The intent is to use one instance of EppScanner per wanted scan, and this instance represents
  # the state after the scan.
  #
  # @example Sample usage
  #   a = "some text <% pp code %> some more text"
  #   scan = StringScanner.new(a)
  #   eppscan = EppScanner.new(scan)
  #   str = eppscan.scan
  #   eppscan.mode # => :epp
  #   eppscan.lines # => 0
  #   eppscan
  #
  # The scanner supports
  # * scanning text until <%, <%-, <%=
  # * while scanning text:
  #   * tokens <%% and %%> are translated to <% and %>, respectively, and is returned as text.
  #   * tokens <%# and %> (or ending with -%>) and the enclosed text is a comment and is not included in the returned text
  #   * text following a comment that ends with -%> gets trailing whitespace (up to and including a line break) trimmed
  #     and this whitespace is not included in the returned text.
  # * The continuation {#mode} is set to one of:
  #   * `:epp` - for a <% token
  #   * `:expr` - for a <%= token
  #   * `:text` - when there was no continuation mode (e.g. when input ends with text)
  #   * ':error` - if the tokens are unbalanced (reaching the end without a closing matching token). An error message
  #     is then also available via the method {#message}.
  #
  # Note that the intent is to use this specialized scanner to scan the text parts, when continuation mode is `:epp` or `:expr`
  # the pp lexer should advance scanning (using the string scanner) until it reaches and consumes a `-%>` or '%>Â´ token. If it
  # finds a `-%> token it should pass this on as a `skip_leading` parameter when it performs the next {#scan}.
