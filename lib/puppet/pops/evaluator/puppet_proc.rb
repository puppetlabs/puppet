# frozen_string_literal: true
# Complies with Proc API by mapping a Puppet::Pops::Evaluator::Closure to a ruby Proc.
# Creating and passing an instance of this class instead of just a plain block makes
# it possible to inherit the parameter info and arity from the closure. Advanced users
# may also access the closure itself. The Puppet::Pops::Functions::Dispatcher uses this
# when it needs to get the Callable type of the closure.
#
# The class is part of the Puppet Function API for Ruby and thus public API but a user
# should never create an instance of this class.

  # all parameters to the closure. The block must be similar to:

  # @param closure [Puppet::Pops::Evaluator::Closure] The closure to map
  # @param &block [Block] The varargs block that invokes the closure.call method
