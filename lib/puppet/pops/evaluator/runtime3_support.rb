    # The 3x way is to record a Puppet::Parser::Relationship that is evaluated at the end of the compilation.
    # This means it is not possible to detect any duplicates at this point (and signal where an attempt is made to
    # add a duplicate. There is also no location information to signal the original place in the logic. The user will have
    # to go fish.
    # The 3.x implementation is based on Strings :-o, so the source and target must be transformed. The resolution is
    # done by Catalog#resource(type, title). To do that, it creates a Puppet::Resource since it is responsible for
    # translating the name/type/title and create index-keys used by the catalog. The Puppet::Resource has bizarre parsing of
    # the type and title (scan for [] that is interpreted as type/title (but it gets it wrong).
    # Moreover if the type is "" or "component", the type is Class, and if the type is :main, it is :main, all other cases
    # undergo capitalization of name-segments (foo::bar becomes Foo::Bar). (This was earlier done in the reverse by the parser).
    # Further, the title undergoes the same munging !!!
    #
    # That bug infested nest of messy logic needs serious Exorcism!
    #
    # Unfortunately it is not easy to simply call more intelligent methods at a lower level as the compiler evaluates the recorded
    # Relationship object at a much later point, and it is responsible for invoking all the messy logic.
    #
    # TODO: Revisit the below logic when there is a sane implementation of the catalog, compiler and resource. For now
    # concentrate on transforming the type references to what is expected by the wacky logic.
    #
    # HOWEVER, the Compiler only records the Relationships, and the only method it calls is @relationships.each{|x| x.evaluate(catalog) }
    # Which means a smarter Relationship class could do this right. Instead of obtaining the resource from the catalog using
    # the borked resource(type, title) which creates a resource for the purpose of looking it up, it needs to instead
    # scan the catalog's resources
    #
    # GAAAH, it is even worse!
    # It starts in the parser, which parses "File['foo']" into an AST::ResourceReference with type = File, and title = foo
    # This AST is evaluated by looking up the type/title in the scope - causing it to be loaded if it exists, and if not, the given
    # type name/title is used. It does not search for resource instances, only classes and types. It returns symbolic information
    # [type, [title, title]]. From this, instances of Puppet::Resource are created and returned. These only have type/title information
    # filled out. One or an array of resources are returned.
    # This set of evaluated (empty reference) Resource instances are then passed to the relationship operator. It creates a
    # Puppet::Parser::Relationship giving it a source and a target that are (empty reference) Resource instances. These are then remembered
    # until the relationship is evaluated by the compiler (at the end). When evaluation takes place, the (empty reference) Resource instances
    # are converted to String (!?! WTF) on the simple format "#{type}[#{title}]", and the catalog is told to find a resource, by giving
    # it this string. If it cannot find the resource it fails, else the before/notify parameter is appended with the target.
    # The search for the resource begin with (you guessed it) again creating an (empty reference) resource from type and title (WTF?!?!).
    # The catalog now uses the reference resource to compute a key [r.type, r.title.to_s] and also gets a uniqueness key from the
    # resource (This is only a reference type created from title and type). If it cannot find it with the first key, it uses the
    # uniqueness key to lookup.
    #
    # This is probably done to allow a resource type to munge/translate the title in some way (but it is quite unclear from the long
    # and convoluted path of evaluation.
    # In order to do this in a way that is similar to 3.x two resources are created to be used as keys.
    #
