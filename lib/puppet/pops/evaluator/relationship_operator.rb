# relationships between the left and right hand side's references to resources.

# This is separate class since a second level of evaluation is required that transforms string in left or right hand
# to type references. The task of "making a relationship" is delegated to the "runtime support" class that is included.
# This is done to separate the concerns of the new evaluator from the 3x runtime; messy logic goes into the runtime support
# module. Later when more is cleaned up this can be simplified further.
