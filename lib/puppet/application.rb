module Puppet

# Defines an abstract Puppet application.
#
# # Usage
#
# To create a new application extend `Puppet::Application`. Derived applications
# must implement the `main` method and should implement the `summary` and
# `help` methods in order to be included in `puppet help`, and should define
# application-specific options. For example:
#
# ```
# class Puppet::Application::Example < Puppet::Application
#
#   def summary
#     "My puppet example application"
#   end
#
#   def help
#     <<~HELP
#     puppet-example(8) -- #{summary}
#     ...
#     HELP
#   end
#
#   # define arg with a required option
#   option("--arg ARGUMENT") do |v|
#     options[:arg] = v
#   end
#
#   # define arg with an optional option
#   option("--maybe [ARGUMENT]") do |v|
#     options[:maybe] = v
#   end
#
#   # define long and short arg
#   option("--all", "-a")
#
#   def initialize(command_line = Puppet::Util::CommandLine.new)
#     super
#     @data = {}
#   end
#
#   def main
#     # call action
#     send(@command_line.args.shift)
#   end
#
#   def read
#     # read action
#   end
#
#   def write
#     # write action
#   end
#
# end
# ```
#
# Puppet defines the following application lifecycle methods that are called in
# the following order:
#
# * {#initialize}
# * {#initialize_app_defaults}
# * {#preinit}
# * {#parse_options}
# * {#setup}
# * {#main}
#
# ## Execution state
# The class attributes/methods of Puppet::Application serve as a global place to set and query the execution
# status of the application: stopping, restarting, etc.  The setting of the application status does not directly
# affect its running status; it's assumed that the various components within the application will consult these
# settings appropriately and affect their own processing accordingly.  Control operations (signal handlers and
# the like) should set the status appropriately to indicate to the overall system that it's the process of
# stopping or restarting (or just running as usual).
#
# So, if something in your application needs to stop the process, for some reason, you might consider:
#
# ```
#  def stop_me!
#    # indicate that we're stopping
#    Puppet::Application.stop!
#    # ...do stuff...
#  end
# ```
#
# And, if you have some component that involves a long-running process, you might want to consider:
#
# ```
#  def my_long_process(giant_list_to_munge)
#    giant_list_to_munge.collect do |member|
#      # bail if we're stopping
#      return if Puppet::Application.stop_requested?
#      process_member(member)
#    end
#  end
# ```
