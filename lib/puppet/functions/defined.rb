# frozen_string_literal: true
# Determines whether a given class or resource type is defined and returns a Boolean
# value. You can also use `defined` to determine whether a specific resource is defined,
# or whether a variable has a value (including `undef`, as opposed to the variable never
# being declared or assigned).
#
# This function takes at least one string argument, which can be a class name, type name,
# resource reference, or variable reference of the form `'$name'`. (Note that the `$` sign
# is included in the string which must be in single quotes to prevent the `$` character
# to be interpreted as interpolation.
#
# The `defined` function checks both native and defined types, including types
# provided by modules. Types and classes are matched by their names. The function matches
# resource declarations by using resource references.
#
# @example Different types of `defined` function matches
#
# ```puppet
# # Matching resource types
# defined("file")
# defined("customtype")
#
# # Matching defines and classes
# defined("foo")
# defined("foo::bar")
#
# # Matching variables (note the single quotes)
# defined('$name')
#
# # Matching declared resources
# defined(File['/tmp/file'])
# ```
#
# Puppet depends on the configuration's evaluation order when checking whether a resource
# is declared.
#
# @example Importance of evaluation order when using `defined`
#
# ```puppet
# # Assign values to $is_defined_before and $is_defined_after using identical `defined`
# # functions.
#
# $is_defined_before = defined(File['/tmp/file'])
#
# file { "/tmp/file":
#   ensure => present,
# }
#
# $is_defined_after = defined(File['/tmp/file'])
#
# # $is_defined_before returns false, but $is_defined_after returns true.
# ```
#
# This order requirement only refers to evaluation order. The order of resources in the
# configuration graph (e.g. with `before` or `require`) does not affect the `defined`
# function's behavior.
#
# > **Warning:** Avoid relying on the result of the `defined` function in modules, as you
# > might not be able to guarantee the evaluation order well enough to produce consistent
# > results. This can cause other code that relies on the function's result to behave
# > inconsistently or fail.
#
# If you pass more than one argument to `defined`, the function returns `true` if _any_
# of the arguments are defined. You can also match resources by type, allowing you to
# match conditions of different levels of specificity, such as whether a specific resource
# is of a specific data type.
#
# @example Matching multiple resources and resources by different types with `defined`
#
# ```puppet
# file { "/tmp/file1":
#   ensure => file,
# }
#
# $tmp_file = file { "/tmp/file2":
#   ensure => file,
# }
#
# # Each of these statements return `true` ...
# defined(File['/tmp/file1'])
# defined(File['/tmp/file1'],File['/tmp/file2'])
# defined(File['/tmp/file1'],File['/tmp/file2'],File['/tmp/file3'])
# # ... but this returns `false`.
# defined(File['/tmp/file3'])
#
# # Each of these statements returns `true` ...
# defined(Type[Resource['file','/tmp/file2']])
# defined(Resource['file','/tmp/file2'])
# defined(File['/tmp/file2'])
# defined('$tmp_file')
# # ... but each of these returns `false`.
# defined(Type[Resource['exec','/tmp/file2']])
# defined(Resource['exec','/tmp/file2'])
# defined(File['/tmp/file3'])
# defined('$tmp_file2')
# ```
