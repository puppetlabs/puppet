# frozen_string_literal: true
# Loads a binary file from a module or file system and returns its contents as a `Binary`.
# The argument to this function should be a `<MODULE NAME>/<FILE>`
# reference, which will load `<FILE>` from a module's `files`
# directory. (For example, the reference `mysql/mysqltuner.pl` will load the
# file `<MODULES DIRECTORY>/mysql/files/mysqltuner.pl`.)
#
# This function also accepts an absolute file path that allows reading
# binary file content from anywhere on disk.
#
# An error is raised if the given file does not exists.
#
# To search for the existence of files, use the `find_file()` function.
