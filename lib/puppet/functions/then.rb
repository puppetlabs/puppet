# frozen_string_literal: true
# Calls a [lambda](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/lang_lambdas.html)
# with the given argument unless the argument is `undef`.
# Returns `undef` if the argument is `undef`, and otherwise the result of giving the
# argument to the lambda.
#
# This is useful to process a sequence of operations where an intermediate
# result may be `undef` (which makes the entire sequence `undef`).
# The `then` function is especially useful with the function `dig` which
# performs in a similar way "digging out" a value in a complex structure.
#
# @example Using `dig` and `then`
#
# ```puppet
# $data = {a => { b => [{x => 10, y => 20}, {x => 100, y => 200}]}}
# notice $data.dig(a, b, 1, x).then |$x| { $x * 2 }
# ```
#
# Would notice the value 200
#
# Contrast this with:
#
# ```puppet
# $data = {a => { b => [{x => 10, y => 20}, {not_x => 100, why => 200}]}}
# notice $data.dig(a, b, 1, x).then |$x| { $x * 2 }
# ```
#
# Which would notice `undef` since the last lookup of 'x' results in `undef` which
# is returned (without calling the lambda given to the `then` function).
#
# As a result there is no need for conditional logic or a temporary (non local)
# variable as the result is now either the wanted value (`x`) multiplied
# by 2 or `undef`.
#
# Calls to `then` can be chained. In the next example, a structure is using an offset based on
# using 1 as the index to the first element (instead of 0 which is used in the language).
# We are not sure if user input actually contains an index at all, or if it is
# outside the range of available names.args.
#
# @example Chaining calls to the `then` function
#
# ```puppet
# # Names to choose from
# $names = ['Ringo', 'Paul', 'George', 'John']
#
# # Structure where 'beatle 2' is wanted (but where the number refers
# # to 'Paul' because input comes from a source using 1 for the first
# # element).
#
# $data = ['singer', { beatle => 2 }]
# $picked = assert_type(String,
#   # the data we are interested in is the second in the array,
#   # a hash, where we want the value of the key 'beatle'
#   $data.dig(1, 'beatle')
#     # and we want the index in $names before the given index
#     .then |$x| { $names[$x-1] }
#     # so we can construct a string with that beatle's name
#     .then |$x| { "Picked Beatle '${x}'" }
# )
# notice $picked
# ```
#
# Would notice "Picked Beatle 'Paul'", and would raise an error if the result
# was not a String.
