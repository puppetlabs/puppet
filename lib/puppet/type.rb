module Puppet
# The base class for all Puppet types.
#
# A type describes:
#--
# * **Attributes** - properties, parameters, and meta-parameters are different types of attributes of a type.
#   * **Properties** - these are the properties of the managed resource (attributes of the entity being managed; like
#     a file's owner, group and mode). A property describes two states; the 'is' (current state) and the 'should' (wanted
#     state).
#       * **Ensurable** - a set of traits that control the lifecycle (create, remove, etc.) of a managed entity.
#         There is a default set of operations associated with being _ensurable_, but this can be changed.
#       * **Name/Identity** - one property is the name/identity of a resource, the _namevar_ that uniquely identifies
#         one instance of a type from all others.
#   * **Parameters** - additional attributes of the type (that does not directly related to an instance of the managed
#     resource; if an operation is recursive or not, where to look for things, etc.). A Parameter (in contrast to Property)
#     has one current value where a Property has two (current-state and wanted-state).
#   * **Meta-Parameters** - parameters that are available across all types. A meta-parameter typically has
#     additional semantics; like the `require` meta-parameter. A new type typically does not add new meta-parameters,
#     but you need to be aware of their existence so you do not inadvertently shadow an existing meta-parameters.
# * **Parent** - a type can have a super type (that it inherits from).
# * **Validation** - If not just a basic data type, or an enumeration of symbolic values, it is possible to provide
#     validation logic for a type, properties and parameters.
# * **Munging** - munging/unmunging is the process of turning a value in external representation (as used
#     by a provider) into an internal representation and vice versa. A Type supports adding custom logic for these.
# * **Auto Requirements** - a type can specify automatic relationships to resources to ensure that if they are being
#     managed, they will be processed before this type.
# * **Providers** - a provider is an implementation of a type's behavior - the management of a resource in the
#     system being managed. A provider is often platform specific and is selected at runtime based on
#     criteria/predicates specified in the configured providers. See {Puppet::Provider} for details.
# * **Device Support** - A type has some support for being applied to a device; i.e. something that is managed
#     by running logic external to the device itself. There are several methods that deals with type
#     applicability for these special cases such as {apply_to_device}.
#
# Additional Concepts:
# --
# * **Resource-type** - A _resource type_ is a term used to denote the type of a resource; internally a resource
#     is really an instance of a Ruby class i.e. {Puppet::Resource} which defines its behavior as "resource data".
#     Conceptually however, a resource is an instance of a subclass of Type (e.g. File), where such a class describes
#     its interface (what can be said/what is known about a resource of this type),
# * **Managed Entity** - This is not a term in general use, but is used here when there is a need to make
#     a distinction between a resource (a description of what/how something should be managed), and what it is
#     managing (a file in the file system). The term _managed entity_ is a reference to the "file in the file system"
# * **Isomorphism** - the quality of being _isomorphic_ means that two resource instances with the same name
#     refers to the same managed entity. Or put differently; _an isomorphic name is the identity of a resource_.
#     As an example, `exec` resources (that executes some command) have the command (i.e. the command line string) as
#     their name, and these resources are said to be non-isomorphic.
#
# @note The Type class deals with multiple concerns; some methods provide an internal DSL for convenient definition
#   of types, other methods deal with various aspects while running; wiring up a resource (expressed in Puppet DSL)
#   with its _resource type_ (i.e. an instance of Type) to enable validation, transformation of values
#   (munge/unmunge), etc. Lastly, Type is also responsible for dealing with Providers; the concrete implementations
#   of the behavior that constitutes how a particular Type behaves on a particular type of system (e.g. how
#   commands are executed on a flavor of Linux, on Windows, etc.). This means that as you are reading through the
#   documentation of this class, you will be switching between these concepts, as well as switching between
#   the conceptual level "a resource is an instance of a resource-type" and the actual implementation classes
#   (Type, Resource, Provider, and various utility and helper classes).

  #   into several parts assigning each to an individual attribute, or even use a composite identity where
  #   all namevars are seen as part of the unique identity (such computation is done by the {#uniqueness} method.
  #   These advanced options are rarely used (only one of the built in puppet types use this, and then only

  #   of a composite identity key (all parts of the key_attributes array are in the key). This can also

  #   The implementation in this method simply assigns the title to the one and only namevar (which is name
  #   or a variable marked as namevar).
  #   If there are multiple namevars (any in addition to :name?) then this method MUST be implemented
  #   as it raises an exception if there is more than 1. Note that in puppet, it is only File that uses this
  #   to create a different pattern for assigning to the :path attribute
  #   This requires further digging.

      When applying a resource in noop mode, Puppet will check whether it is in sync,
      like it does when running normally. However, if a resource attribute is not in
      the desired state (as declared in the catalog), Puppet will take no
      action, and will instead report the changes it _would_ have made. These
      simulated changes will appear in the report sent to the primary Puppet server, or
      be shown on the console if running puppet agent or puppet apply in the
      foreground. The simulated changes will not send refresh events to any
      subscribing or notified resources, although Puppet will log that a refresh
      event _would_ have been sent.

      **Important note:**
      [The `noop` setting](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/configuration.html#noop)
      allows you to globally enable or disable noop mode, but it will _not_ override
      the `noop` metaparameter on individual resources. That is, the value of the
      global `noop` setting will _only_ affect resources that do not have an explicit
      value set for their `noop` attribute."

      Auditing a resource attribute has two effects: First, whenever a catalog
      is applied with puppet apply or puppet agent, Puppet will check whether
      that attribute of the resource has been modified, comparing its current
      value to the previous run; any change will be logged alongside any actions
      performed by Puppet while applying the catalog.

      Secondly, marking a resource attribute for auditing will include that
      attribute in inspection reports generated by puppet inspect; see the
      puppet inspect documentation for more details.

      Managed attributes for a resource can also be audited, but note that
      changes made by Puppet will be logged as additional modifications. (I.e.
      if a user manually edits a file whose contents are audited and managed,
      puppet agent's next two runs will both log an audit notice: the first run
      will log the user's edit and then revert the file to the desired state,

  newmetaparam(:alias) do

          service { 'sshd':
            subscribe => File['sshdconfig'],
          }

      When you use this feature, the parser sets `sshdconfig` as the title,
      and the library sets that as an alias for the file so the dependency
      lookup in `Service['sshd']` works.  You can use this metaparameter yourself,
      but note that aliases generally only work for creating relationships; anything
      else that refers to an existing resource (such as amending or overriding
      resource attributes in an inherited class) must use the resource's exact
      title. For example, the following code will not work:

          file { '/etc/ssh/sshd_config':
            owner => root,
            group => root,
            alias => 'sshdconfig',

          File['sshdconfig'] {
            mode => '0644',
          }

      should be affecting the same file.
