  # Strip indentation and trailing whitespace from embedded doc fragments.
  #
  # Multi-line doc fragments are sometimes indented in order to preserve the
  # formatting of the code they're embedded in. Since indents are syntactic
  # elements in Markdown, we need to make sure we remove any indent that was
  # added solely to preserve surrounding code formatting, but LEAVE any indent
  # that delineates a Markdown element (code blocks, multi-line bulleted list
  # items). We can do this by removing the *least common indent* from each line.
  #
  # Least common indent is defined as follows:
  #
  # * Find the smallest amount of leading space on any line...
  # * ...excluding the first line (which may have zero indent without affecting
  #   the common indent)...
  # * ...and excluding lines that consist solely of whitespace.
  # * The least common indent may be a zero-length string, if the fragment is
  #   not indented to match code.
  # * If there are hard tabs for some dumb reason, we assume they're at least
  #   consistent within this doc fragment.
  #
  # See tests in spec/unit/util/docs_spec.rb for examples.
