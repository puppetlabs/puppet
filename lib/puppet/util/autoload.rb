      # This is a little bit of a hack.  Basically, the autoloader is being
      # called indirectly during application bootstrapping when we do things
      # such as check "features".  However, during bootstrapping, we haven't
      # yet parsed all of the command line parameters nor the config files,
      # and thus we don't yet know with certainty what the module path is.
      # This should be irrelevant during bootstrapping, because anything that
      # we are attempting to load during bootstrapping should be something
      # that we ship with puppet, and thus the module path is irrelevant.
      #
      # In the long term, I think the way that we want to handle this is to
      # have the autoloader ignore the module path in all cases where it is
      # not specifically requested (e.g., by a constructor param or
      # something)... because there are very few cases where we should
      # actually be loading code from the module path.  However, until that
      # happens, we at least need a way to prevent the autoloader from
      # attempting to access the module path before it is initialized.  For
      # now we are accomplishing that by calling the
      # "app_defaults_initialized?" method on the main puppet Settings object.
