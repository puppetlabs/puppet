# frozen_string_literal: true
# A Provider is an implementation of the actions that manage resources (of some type) on a system.
# This class is the base class for all implementation of a Puppet Provider.
#
# Concepts:
#--
# * **Confinement** - confinement restricts providers to only be applicable under certain conditions.
#    It is possible to confine a provider several different ways:
#    * the included {#confine} method which provides filtering on fact, feature, existence of files, or a free form
#      predicate.
#    * the {commands} method that filters on the availability of given system commands.
# * **Property hash** - the important instance variable `@property_hash` contains all current state values
#   for properties (it is lazily built). It is important that these values are managed appropriately in the
#   methods {instances}, {prefetch}, and in methods that alters the current state (those that change the
#   lifecycle (creates, destroys), or alters some value reflected backed by a property).
# * **Flush** - is a hook that is called once per resource when everything has been applied. The intent is
#   that an implementation may defer modification of the current state typically done in property setters
#   and instead record information that allows flush to perform the changes more efficiently.
# * **Execution Methods** -  The execution methods provides access to execution of arbitrary commands.
#   As a convenience execution methods are available on both the instance and the class of a provider since a
#   lot of provider logic switch between these contexts fairly freely.
# * **System Entity/Resource** - this documentation uses the term "system entity" for system resources to make
#   it clear if talking about a resource on the system being managed (e.g. a file in the file system)
#   or about a description of such a resource (e.g. a Puppet Resource).
# * **Resource Type** - this is an instance of Type that describes a classification of instances of Resource (e.g.
#   the `File` resource type describes all instances of `file` resources).
#   (The term is used to contrast with "type" in general, and specifically to contrast with the implementation
#   class of Resource or a specific Type).
#
# @note An instance of a Provider is associated with one resource.
#
# @note Class level methods are only called once to configure the provider (when the type is created), and not
#   for each resource the provider is operating on.
#   The instance methods are however called for each resource.
