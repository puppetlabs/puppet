# Each environment can have an environment.conf file. Its settings will only
# affect its own environment. See docs for more info:
# https://docs.puppetlabs.com/puppet/latest/reference/config_file_environment.html

# Any unspecified settings use default values; some of those defaults are based
# on puppet.conf settings.

# If these settings include relative file paths, they'll be resolved relative to
# this environment's directory.

# Allowed settings and default values:

# modulepath = ./modules:$basemodulepath
# manifest = (default_manifest from puppet.conf, which defaults to ./manifests)
# config_version = (no script; Puppet will use the time the catalog was compiled)
# environment_timeout = (environment_timeout from puppet.conf, which defaults to 0)
    # Note: unless you have a specific reason, we recommend only setting
    # environment_timeout in puppet.conf.
