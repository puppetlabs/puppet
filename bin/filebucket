# = Synopsis
#
# A stand-alone Puppet filebucket client.
#
# = Usage
#
#   filebucket [-h|--help] [-V|--version] [-d|--debug] [-v|--verbose]
#      [-l|--local] [-r|--remote]
#      [-s|--server <server>] [-b|--bucket <directory>] <file> <file> ...
#
# = Description
#
# This is a stand-alone filebucket client for sending files to a local
# or central filebucket.
#
# = Usage
#
# This client can operate in three modes, with only one mode per call:
#
# backup::
#   Send one or more files to the specified file bucket.  Each sent file
#   is printed with its resulting md5 sum.
#
# get::
#   Return the text associated with an md5 sum.  The text is printed to
#   stdout, and only one file can be retrieved at a time.
#
# restore::
#   Given a file path and an md5 sum, store the content associated with the
#   sum into the specified file path.  You can specify an entirely new path
#   to this argument; you are not restricted to restoring the content to its
#   original location.
#
# Note that +filebucket+ defaults to using a network-based filebucket available on
# the server named +puppet+.  To use this, you'll have to be running as a user
# with valid Puppet certificates.  Alternatively, you can use your local file bucket
# by specifying +--local+.
#
# = Example
#
#   $ filebucket backup /etc/passwd
#   /etc/passwd: 429b225650b912a2ee067b0a4cf1e949
#   $ filebucket restore /tmp/passwd 429b225650b912a2ee067b0a4cf1e949
#   $
#
# = Options
#
# Note that any configuration parameter that's valid in the configuration file
# is also a valid long argument.  For example, 'ssldir' is a valid configuration
# parameter, so you can specify '--ssldir <directory>' as an argument.
#
# See the configuration file documentation at
# http://puppetlabs.com/trac/puppet/wiki/ConfigurationReference for
# the full list of acceptable parameters. A commented list of all
# configuration options can also be generated by running puppet with
# '--genconfig'.
#
# debug::
#   Enable full debugging.
#
# help::
#   Print this help message
#
# local::
#   Use the local filebucket.  This will use the default configuration
#   information.
#
# remote::
#   Use a remote filebucket.  This will use the default configuration
#   information.
#
# server::
#   The server to send the file to, instead of locally.
#
# verbose::
#   Print extra information.
#
# version::
#   Print version information.
#
# = Example
#
#   filebucket -b /tmp/filebucket /my/file
