Report
======
This document describes the Puppet master's report endpoint and the schema for Report Format 4 in technical term. Also see the [documentation](http://docs.puppetlabs.com/puppet/latest/reference/format_report.html).

The `report` endpoint allows clients to send reports to the master via `http` or `https`.
Once received by the master they are processed by the *report processors* configured to be 
triggered when a report is received. As an example, storing reports in PuppetDB is handled by
one such report processor.

Endpoint
--------
The http(s) endpoint for sending reports to the master is:

    PUT /:environment/report/:nodename

### Supported HTTP Methods

    PUT

### Supported Format(s)

    Accept: pson, text/pson

### Parameters

    None

### Content

The content of a report is typically generated by the Puppet Runtime and consists of a pson-serialization of `Puppet::Transaction::Report` object which in turn contains a structure of objects with of the following runtime types:

* `Puppet::Util::Log`
* `Puppet::Util::Metric`
* `Puppet::Resource::Status`
* `Puppet::Transaction::Event` 

This pson-serialization is compliant with the endpoint's report jsonschema.

#### Schema

The report schema (`api/schemas/report.json`) is expressed using json-schema draft 4, ["http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema#"](http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema#).

The body of the PUT to the report endpoint should be compliant with this schema.

Example
-------
Here is an example of a PUT request. (Note that the content-length is not correct as the
example is formatted for readability)

    PUT /production/report/kermit.com HTTP/1.0
