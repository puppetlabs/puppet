# Allow all nodes to access all file services; this is necessary for
# pluginsync, file serving from modules, and file serving from custom
# mount points (see fileserver.conf). Note that the `/file` prefix matches
# requests to both the file_metadata and file_content paths. See "Examples"
# above if you need more granular access control for custom mount points.

### Unauthenticated ACLs, for clients without valid certificates; authenticated
### clients can also access these paths, though they rarely need to.
